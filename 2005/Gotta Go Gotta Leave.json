I gotta leave\nSo please don't make it hard for me\nI've gave enough, I'm tired of love\nI gotta let it go... \nCouldn't have given you more\nGave you everything\nThere wasn't anything that you were denied (yeah)\nBut you should never give it all...\n'cause sometimes there's nothing left\nBut bitterness and regret\nAnd it just ain't worth it\n'Cause then there's the sudden change\nOut of nowhere, it seems\nNever know I could be so mean\nBut that's just how far you pushed me (yeah)\nYou say it just isn't fair\nAnd you didn't know\nYou need to take responsibility for your own\n'cause you're grown\nAnd you known (yeah)\n\nI gotta go. I gotta leave\nSo please don't make it hard for me\nI've gave enough, I'm tired of love\nI gotta let it go... \nNow I take the blame\nFor trying to stay and work it out\nShoulda left before it got complicated\nShoulda left when there was still some happiness\nYes I take the blame\nFor having faith in the relationship\nI thought it made me complete\nBut the truth is\nI'm complete without it\nYeah-eah\n(Gotta Let Go-ooo-ooo-oo)\n\nI gotta go. I gotta leave\nSo please don't make it hard for me\nI've gave enough, I'm tired of love\nI gotta let it go... ",
