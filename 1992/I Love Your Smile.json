 "lyrics": "Sitting in my class\nJust drifting away\nStaring into the windows of the world\nYeah\nI can't hear the teacher\nHis books don't call me at all\nI don't see the bad boys trying to catch some play\n\n'Cause I love your smile\nI love your smile\n\nThe clock at work says three\nAnd I wanna be free\nFree to scream, free to bathe\nFree to paint my toes all day, woo!\nMy boss is lame you know\nAnd so is the pay\nI'm gonna put that new black mini on my charge anyway\n\n'Cause I love your smile\nHey, said I love your smile\n\nTime came and showed me your direction\nNow I know I'll never ever go back\nTaught me that\nI can be a better girl\nWith the love you give\nYou rock my world\nYou dig?\n\nI'm showin' the life that I'm living\nThis is the life that I have and it's given to you\nYeah and it's true\nLa-dee-da\nTwinkly dee\nDo you, believe in a girl like me?\nShanice is the one for you to be with\nBut when I'm caught all alone\nI start fessing\nIt's from a state of depression\nAnd the thunder clouds of doubt move in\nI begin to wonder\n\"Do you still love me?\"\nBut after that\nMy whole world is beautiful\n\n\nBlow, Branford, blow\n\nTime came and showed me your direction\nNow I know I'll never ever go back\nTaught me that\nI can be a better girl\nWith the love you give\nYou rock my world\nSmile, sike\n\nOoh, I love your smile (smile for me)\nYes I do boy, hee\nI love your smile\nI love your smile, baby\n\nHeee, heee, heeee, heeeee\nI love your smile\nI really do (hahahahahaha)",
