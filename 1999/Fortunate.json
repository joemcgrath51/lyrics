 "lyrics": "Never seen a sun shine like this\nNever seen the moon glow like this\nNever seen the waterfalls like this\nNever seen the lights off like this\nNever dug anyone like this\nNever had tasty lips to kiss\nNever had someone to miss\nNever wrote a song quite like this\n\nFortunate to have you girl\nI'm so glad you're in my world\nJust as sure as the sky is blue\nI bless the day that I found you\n\nNever had room service all night\nNever took a trip first class flight\nNever had a love affair so tight\nI've never felt a feeling so right\nNever seen a winter so white\nNever had words to recite\nNever had a flame to ignite\nAnd I never sang a song with all my might\n\n\n(Can you hear the sound?)\nSilence child hope you hear\nI'm callin out to your body\n(I'm calling out) Baby you know just what to do\nClose the door no interlude\n(Put your hand together now)",
