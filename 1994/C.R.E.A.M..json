Move from the gate now\n\nCash rules everything around me\nC.R.E.A.M., get the money\nDollar dollar bill, y'all\nCash rules everything around me\nC.R.E.A.M., get the money\nDollar dollar bill, y'all\n\nIt's been twenty-two long, hard years, I'm still strugglin'\nSurvival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival\nI peep at the shape of the streets\nAnd stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep\nA man with a dream with plans to make cream\nWhich failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen\nA young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much\nTryin' to get a clutch at what I could not\u2014\nThe court played me short, now I face incarceration\nPacin', goin' upstate's my destination\nHandcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us\nLife as a shorty shouldn't be so rough\nBut as the world turned, I learned life is hell\nLivin' in the world no different from a cell\nEvery day I escape from Jakes givin' chase\nSellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase\nThough I don't know why I chose to smoke sess\nI guess that's the time when I'm not depressed\nBut I'm still depressed, and I ask: what's it worth?\nReady to give up so I seek the old Earth\nWho explained workin' hard may help you maintain\nTo learn to overcome the heartaches and pain\nWe got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks\nAnd stray shots, all on the block that stays hot\nLeave it up to me while I be livin' proof\nTo kick the truth to the young black youth\nBut shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer\nAnd ain't tryna hear what I'm kickin' in his ear\nNeglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted\nThat what? That life is hectic\n\nCash rules everything around me\nC.R.E.A.M., get the money\nDollar dollar bill, y'all\nCash rules everything around me (My niggas gots to do what they gotta do)\nC.R.E.A.M., get the money\nDollar dollar bill, y'all (To get through, know what I'm sayin'?)\nCash rules everything around me (Because you can't just get by no more)\nC.R.E.A.M., get the money\nDollar dollar bill, y'all (Word up, you gotta get over, straight up and down)\nCash rules everything around me\nC.R.E.A.M., get the money\nDollar dollar bill, y'all\n\nYeah, yeah\nCash rules everything around me\nC.R.E.A.M., get the money\nDollar dollar bill, y'all\nCash rules everything around me\nC.R.E.A.M., get the money\nDollar dollar bill, y'all\nCash rules everything around me\nC.R.E.A.M., get the money\nDollar dollar bill, y'all\nCash rules everything around me\nC.R.E.A.M., get the money\nDollar dollar bill, y'all-all-all, yeah",
