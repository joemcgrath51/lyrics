 "lyrics": "I can't imagine life\nWithout you by my side\nThis is love baby that I'm feeling\nAnd I'm hoping\nThat you're feeling the same way\nThings tend to slip my mind\nLike how you like to wine and dine, baby\nWith romantic lights, you mean a lot to me\nIn so many ways\n\nLately\nHave I told you I love you\nLately\nHave I told you you still mean the world to me\nLately\nHave I told you I love you\nI'll be your wishing well\nTell me what you want baby\n\nDon't think twice of our love\nI say these things because\nI love you but it's hard to explain\nAnd I'm hoping that you're feeling the same way\nYou know that all of my\nFeelings are inside\nAnd verbally I tend to forget\nHow much I L-O-V-E you really means\n\nLately\nHave I told you I love you\nLately\nHave I told you you still mean the world to me\nLately\nHave I told you I love you\nI'll be your wishing well\nTell me what you want, baby\n\nTry your hardest to deal\nYes I forgot but you know how I feel\nThings slip my mind baby that's a fact\nTell me you love me\nAnd I'll tell you...\nBack baby\nLately, ohh\nLately\nI love you babe\nI love you\nI love you\nI love you\n\nHold me close to you\nNever let me go",
