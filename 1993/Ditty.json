 "lyrics": "Yo, this is how I'm comin' for the nine deuce\nAnother phat, phat track, so Rhythm D, pour the orange juice\nAnd let's relax while sippin' on 'gnac because it's like that\nI'm cautious of hoes, so Paperboy wears prophylactic\nI wear a jimmy for the skinny that's in the long trench\nFront row seats, so yo I know she's on the nine inch\nJust to get a piece of the green, but she's an undertaker\nNot knowin' the paper is a 'round the world heart-breaker\nMany say I front, but yo, had to have a break down\nPlayin' you fools, so now you know why my belly's round\nTakin' the rap back up and scoopin' up crowds just like a steel shovel\nNot from the ghetto, but yo, take me to another level\nLet the beat ride, but hold on to your woman, G\n'Cause now that I'm rich so many women wanna do me\nIt make a man say 'damn'\nI'm finally taxin' more than your homey Sam\nBut let me speak to the weak, I mean the rookies\nMy time is held up, extremely for cookies\nJust let me clock this grip in ninety-two\nAnd you don't bother me and I sure 'nuff won't bother you\nAnd uh, you just watch a brother flowin' like Niagara\nThink before you step, because these lyrics just might stag ya\nAlthough I'm labeled with the black fade\nIt's gold D's on my four and gold 'lex, 'cause I got it made\nI broke the veto once again because I had to\nAnd just like Jody Watley, baby girl, I can have you\nJust let me work this track, and yo, any way is OK\nYour place or mine, all night until the next day, huh\n\nDo the Ditty if you want to\nBecause then I can see if I want you\nJust do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to\nBecause then I can see if I want you\nJust do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to\nBecause then I can see if I want you\nJust do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to\nBecause then I can see if I want you\nNow here we go from the top, second verse of the same song\nWith the conclusion, hoes should be happy for the ding-dong\nAnd since a man clock a grip, G\nIt's like every nigga that I see be like, 'Do you remember me?'\nA hustler, and it's known with more hoes than Lego\nKeep 'em chunky like Prego, so niggas leggo my Eggo\nI have a tendency to flow, start off with my own groove\nAnd pick up the mic, and all of a sudden, I see high movin'\nGuess it's like magic, and Paperboy is the magician\nIf I was a vacuum I'd be suckin' up competition\nLet it ride again, and yo, believe I got my own thing\nStraight Bahama hoes so miss me with a chick from Soul Train\nAnd I'm a break my note, just to show up tokin'\nSo hide his eyes when I scoop him, 'cause we bud smokin'\nA black man tryin' to make it and that ain't no fair\nBut just like BeBe and CeCe, I'll take you there, huh\n\nDo the Ditty if you want to\nBecause then I can see if I want you\nJust do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to\nBecause then I can see if I want you\nJust do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to\nBecause then I can see if I want you\nJust do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to\nBecause then I can see if I want you\nNow here we go, uh, let's take a trip to another land\nClock a grip, come back and watch the hoes tan\nJump in the Lex-o, and roll out to my cabin\nBelieve me my brother, more hoes than you can imagine\nAll on the ding-a-ling, just because the gold rings\nBut I'm like 'What's up with ya? You ain't heard a damn thing'\nMake sure you got the jim hats, strapped for protection\nBecause to me, my life is more than my erection\nAnd give me a hand, if you a fan, it ain't over yet\n'Cause doin' the Ditty with Paperboy makes the ocean sweat\nKick the kind of style that knock the funk off of Fritos\nMake you man jealous while hoes cheese like Doritos\nIt ain't my fault, I lay the pipe with concern-and\nI ain't from Mount Vernon, but a brother's money-earnin'\nAnd don't disagree and then jock, that's a pity\nJust bob your head for Paperboy and the Ditty\nYeah\n\nDo the Ditty if you want to\nBecause then I can see if I want you\nTo do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to\nBecause then I can see if I want you\nJust do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to\nBecause then I can see if I want you\nJust do the Ditty if you want to\nBecause then I can see if I want you\nTo do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to\nBecause then I can see if I want you\nJust do the Ditty if you want to\nBecause then I can see if I want you",
