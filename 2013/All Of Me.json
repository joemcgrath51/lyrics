 "lyrics": "What would I do without your smart mouth?\nDrawin' me in and you kickin' me out\nYou've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'\nI can't pin you down\nWhat's goin' on in that beautiful mind?\nI'm on your magical mystery ride\nAnd I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me\nBut I'll be alright\n\nMy head's under water, but I'm breathing fine\nYou're crazy and I'm out of my mind\n\n'Cause all of me\nLoves all of you\nLove your curves and all your edges\nAll your perfect imperfections\nGive your all to me\nI'll give my all to you\nYou're my end and my beginnin'\nEven when I lose, I'm winnin'\n\n'Cause I give you all of me\nAnd you give me all of you, oh-oh\n\nHow many times do I have to tell you?\nEven when you're crying, you're beautiful too\nThe world is beating you down, I'm around\nThrough every mood\nYou're my downfall, you're my muse\nMy worst distraction, my rhythm and blues\nI can't stop singing, it's ringing\nIn my head for you\n\nMy head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine\nYou're crazy and I'm out of my mind\n\n'Cause all of me\nLoves all of you\nLove your curves and all your edges\nAll your perfect imperfections\nGive your all to me\nI'll give my all to you\nYou're my end and my beginnin'\nEven when I lose, I'm winnin'\n\n'Cause I give you all of me\nAnd you give me all of you, oh-oh\n\nGive me all of you, oh\nCards on the table, we're both showing hearts\nRisking it all, though it's hard\n\n'Cause all of me\nLoves all of you\nLove your curves and all your edges\nAll your perfect imperfections\nGive your all to me\nI'll give my all to you\nYou're my end and my beginnin'\nEven when I lose, I'm winnin'\n\n'Cause I give you all of me\nAnd you give me all of you\n\nI give you all of me\nAnd you give me all of you, oh-oh",
