We\u2019re focusing solely on RAP PERFORMANCE\nPlease also remember that the verses posted are not the only verses being compared. All the verses in all of these verses are being compared however some verses are posted over others in order to save space, show the highlights, and other reasons. For songs you are not familiar with please look at all the lyrics which is linked in each comparison while also watching/listening to the song/video that is also posted\nBoth are considered to be the among the best white emcees of all time and some of the biggest lyrical heavyweights in the rap game period. Both seem to have their softer and more heartfelt moments while they can also get wild and crazy. In order to properly compare the two lets compare songs of both emcees catalogs in the following categories\nTechnical Lyrical Abiltiy: Generally in music lyricism is the ability to write lyrics for a song and convey a message, story, and etc.. However, in the context of hip hop discussions we will limit technical lyrical ability to mean the way an emcee rhymes. Their utilization of multiple complex rhyming techniques such as intricate rhyme schemes, multisyallble rhymes, internal rhymes, and etc\u2026 Things such as storytelling, song writing, content and other things usually associated with the word lyricism or lyricist in music generally will be analyzed in other categories. This is strictly the technical side of rhymes\nStorytelling: This category will strictly analyze the way the emcees convey a story, while keeping in mind the uniqness and intricacies of the story plot themselves along with the way the artist conveys the story by utilizing poetic devices such as vivid imagery, and etc\u2026\nSocially Conscious/Content: A lot of emcees could rap very technical, however technicality is not the only thing when it comes to rap. This category will focus on what the emcee is saying and comparing the emcees most substantive and socially conscious songs, which includes songs with a message along with commentary on social issues, history, politics, religion, and etc\u2026\nQuotables/Punchlines: This category will compare the best individual lines of the emcees. The lines will be a mixture of\n1. Punchlines, which is typiucally a line that is humorous, clever, witty, and uses wordplay or something along these lines\n2. Quotables, which is a line that is not necessarily witty but is.. quotable. For example nas saying \u201cI never sleep, because sleep is the cousin of death\u201d is an example of a hard hitting quotable. It could be some type of law of wisdom that is timeless and never get\u2019s old. Jadakiss has SOO many of these with a broad example when he said: \u201cAnd you know they say that you deserved it whenever you die with your eyes open\u201d\nA good mixture that oscillates between the two would be a test of their wittiness, wordplay, and even substance\nTechnical Lyrical Abiltiy 1\nRap God vs Definition of a rap flow\nHttp://genius.com/Eminem-rap-god-lyrics\nHttp://genius.com/Ra-the-rugged-man-definition-of-a-rap-flow-lyrics\nRap God: I will only post the longest and highlight verse of the song to save space but we are comparing all the verses in each of the songs\nHttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbGs_qK2PQA\nCause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nThe way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR\nDale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God\nKneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton No Asgard, Asgard\nSo you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent\nLet off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm toting\nAnd I should not be woken\nI'm the walking dead\nBut I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating\nBut I got your mom deep throating\nI'm out my Ramen Noodle\nWe have nothing in common, poodle\nI'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil\nIt's me\nMy honesty's brutal\nBut it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though\nFor good at least once in a while\nSo I wanna make sure somewhere\nIn this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle\nEnough rhymes to\nMaybe try to help get some people through tough times\nBut I gotta keep a few punchlines\nJust in case cause even you unsigned\nRappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime\nI know there was a time where once I, was king of the underground\nBut I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind\nSo I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine\nAppeal with the skin color of mine\nYou get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line\nI said on \"I'm Back\" from the Mathers LP 1\nWhen I tried to say\n\"I'll take seven kids from Columbine\nPut 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine\"\nSee if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was but I'm\nMorphin' into an immortal\nComing through the portal\nYou're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though\nAnd I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for\nYou're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking\nCornrows\nYou write normal?

rape the bitch and snatch her purse\nNow I wanna kill her but yo, I gotta catch her first\nRan through Rally's parkin' lot and took a shortcut\nSaw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch

now, she said \"Come in, it's unlocked\"\nI walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne\nAnd seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn\nShe said \"Come here big boy, let's get acquainted\"\nI turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it\nShe came at me at full speed, nothing could stop her\nI shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her\nI started to beg \"No, please let go\"\nBut she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll\nWith one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled\nI grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple\nJust tryna buy me some time then I remembered this magic trick\nDuh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh, go-go gadget dick!\nWhipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it\nIt hit the ground and caused an earthquake

register, dip before somebody catches ya\nOr gets your description and sketches ya\nThen connects you as the prime suspect\nBut I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet\nCause I got a daughter to feed\nAnd two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed\nThe best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell\nAnd hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring\nMoney from the safe in the back, stepped in waving the Mac\nCo-operate, and we can operate, and save an attack\nThis bitch tried escaping the jack, grabbed her by the throat\nIt's murder she wrote, you barely heard

I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp!\"\nDrug her by her hair, smacked her up\nThinking fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up\nStole her car and made a profit, grabbed the tape from out the deck\nAnd lost it out the window like the girl in Set It Off did\nJetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal\nDrove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimming pool\nClimbed out and collapsed on the patio\nI made it out alive but I'm injured badly though\nParents screaming, \"Johnny go in and call the police\nTell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace\"\nTried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up\nRun in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff\nActing like they never seen nobody hit a lick before\nSmashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64\nWhen they sell out in stores the price triples\nI ran up the block jumping kids on tricycles\nAnd collided with an 80-year-old lady with groceries\nThere goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties\nStood up and started to see stars\nToo many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars\nBarely escaped, must'a been some dumb luck\nJumped up and climbed the back of a moving dump truck\nBut I think somebody seen me maybe\nPlus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must'a dropped a Beanie Baby\nFuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits\nCame out with a white flag hollering \"truce-truce\"\nAnd surrendered my weapon to cops\nWasn't me, it was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps\nSmithhaven Mall- RA the rugged

higher anarchy\nStrap him with an AK-47, let him go\nFight his own war, let him impress daddy that way\nNo more blood for oil, we got our own battles\nTo fight on our own soil, no more psychological

content\nThe song \"Guilty Conscience\" has gotten such rotten responses\"\nAnd all of this controversy circles me\nAnd it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me\nSo I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie\nOr the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up\nWhen you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up\nWith the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too\nWhen a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school\nAnd they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin\nWhere were the parents at and look where it's at\nMiddle America, now it's a tragedy\nNow it's so sad to see, an upper-class city\nHavin' this happening\nThen attack Eminem cause I rap this way\nBut I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire\nTo burn and it's burning and I

ain't rappers, you more like crooked politicians\nPart of who's creation, new nation\nTrying to fuck us with no lubrication\nRaping, never losing to Lucifer Satan\nCalling me Canaan the caveman in the cave, came close but never caved in\nThe false image of a prophet you praising\nYou living in a nation living in intidimation\nDue to primitive media manipulation\nTerror tactics and intidimation, we lack innovation\nLooking for more fame they control your brain\nThe gullible puppets of the public get played like a board game\nGet your jaw reconstructed, I ain't no puppet\nAin't throwing up no diamonds, here's the middle finger, go shove it\nRenegade vs Change Gonna Come\nRenegade- Eminem\nSince I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen\nI ain't no politician but I'll kick it with em a minute\nCause, see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits I'll wear it\nBut if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it\nNow who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics\nWho could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics\nUsing his music to steer it, sharing his views and his merits\nBut there's a huge interference: they're saying you shouldn't hear it\nMaybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit\nMaybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish\nBut I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America\nAs a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment, nah nah\nThat's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror\nAnd see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed\nAnd I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents\nYou fucking do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage\nAnd do you have any clue what I had to do to get here\nI don't think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo\nCause here we go, he's {\u200b*Jigga j-Jigga*}\u200b\nAnd I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass, it's just the\nSee I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare\nJesus Christ, the King of these Latter-Day Saints here\nTo shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as\nAs a monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist\nBut that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste\nWe as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is\nOr is he the latter, a gateway to escape\nMedia scapegoat; who they can be mad at today\nSee it's easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie\nWhile I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me\nGo to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics\nIn holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer\nI'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful\nThe new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you\nWhat did I do, I'm just a kid from the gutter\nMaking this butter off these bloodsuckers\nCause I'm a muthafuckin'\nChange gonna come- RA the rugged man\nHttps://youtu.be/_0mYlvhPAQ4?t=155\nCriminal acts in the dark doubling, the hearts suffering\nThe odds I'm duckin' 'em, all this hatred towards God is troubling\nSavages living sacrilegious, a bunch of babbling bitches\nSatan disguised as media attacking the scriptures, attracting the lizards\nDemons accusing the righteous of being the bigots\nAnd brainwashed children in society believing the critics\nKilling, living in a sin, and sittin' in a cell in prison\nLacking of independent thinking is sickening\nStop following the public opinion\nThey tricking you to support the corrupt system\nKeeping your thoughts limited, inhibited with no knowledge or wisdom\nI'm breaking the demon, the fake heathen, it's Hate Season\nAny snake deceiving, I'll make sure they no longer ain't breathing\nWas I born a savage and having to sin\nCan they mentally and morally civilize a savage and make him a king?\nMaking the misfortunate forfeit, poisoning the piss-poor kids\nBio-hazardous chemicals out the sink faucets\nWhen the moon turn red, that's the end and everybody dies\nMeteor-showers and lambs with 7 horns and 7 eyes\nPutting and end to earth's evils, six-wing creatures\nFour different kinds with faces of lions, ox's and eagles\nCome on\nHeadlights vs Legends Never Die (Daddys
