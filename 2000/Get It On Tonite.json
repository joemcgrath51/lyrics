So I'm schemin'\nI can't go on like this, believin'\nThat her love is true, oh\nStanding on the dance floor while she trickin'\nYou are all I want girl, \nshe's a chicken\nWe might be together but love is missin'\nGirl, I want you\nSo what can we do? Oh\n\nGirl if it's alright (Oh)\nLet's go somewhere and get it on tonight (Let's get it on)\nI've got a girl, but you look good tonight (You look so good, baby)\nIt's one on one tonight (You babe), tonight\nGirl if it's alright (Alright)\nLet's go somewhere and get it on tonight (Yeah, get it on)\nYou shouldn't have to be alone tonight (Yeah, yeah)\nIt's one on one tonight, tonight (One on one, baby)\n\nNow she's lookin' at me\nBut keep talkin'\nOh, now she tryna ice you\nLet's start walkin'\nOver on the dance floor\nIt's her fault but what can she do?\nTell me baby, yeah\n\nGirl if you're ready (I'm ready)\nWe can get it on (We can get it on)\nI know where I went wrong\n(She's where you went wrong)\nWith you is where I belong, belong\n\nGirl if I could find the words to say\nI gotta get away from a love\nThat kills me everyday\nI'd gladly say to you\n\nGirl if it's alright\nLet's go somewhere and get it on tonight\nI've got a girl, but you look good tonight\nIt's one on one tonight, tonight\nGirl if it's alright\nLet's go somewhere and get it on tonight\nYou shouldn't have to be alone tonight\nIt's one on one tonight, tonight\n\nMy baby's stressin' me\nYou need to come with me\nWe need to go somewhere, yeah\nTonight, tonight\n\nGirl if it's alright\nLet's go somewhere and get it on tonight\nI've got a girl, but you look good tonight",
