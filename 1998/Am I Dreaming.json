 "lyrics": "Am I dreaming baby?\nAre you for real?\nThings are kind of hazy\nAnd my head's all cloudy inside (Inside)\nNow I've heard talk of angels, baby\nBut never though I would have one to call mine\n(Never thought)\nSee you are just too good to be true\nAnd I hope\nThere's not some kinda mirage\nWith you, oh baby\n1-Am I dreaming\nAm I just imagining you're here in my life\nAm I dreaming\nPinch me to see if it's real\nCuz my mind can't decide\nCuz my mind can't decide\nNo, no, no, no, no, oh\nWill this last for one night\nOr do I have you for all time\nPlease say that it's forever\nAnd that it's not an illusion to my eye\nAnd I, I hope\nThat you just don't up and disappear\nMy love I pray\nThat it's not a hoax and it's for real, oh\n(rpt 1)\nHear me out now\nSometimes say that sometimes\nI need you to show me girl\n(oh baby, I need you)\nShow me that you're not a mirage\n(I need you)\nI need you\nOh, I need you to pinch me baby\nI need you to pinch me baby\nAm I\nAm I dreaming\nAm I just imagining you're here in my life\nAm I dreaming\nPinch me to see if it's real\nCuz my mind can't decide",
