My feelings, they show\nI think I'd better not look back\nI've been down a little too long\nAnd now it's time that I get on track\nSo I must...\n[Chorus: Jodeci & \nK-Ci\n]\nTreat 'em like they wanna be treated\n(\nWhat you need to do\n)\nTreat 'em like they wanna be treated\n(\nYou should treat them right\n)\nYou should treat 'em right\n[Verse 2: Father MC & \nJoJo\n]\nI like to mingle when I do mingle\nI love to mingle when I do flirt\nI get off hand and tell the stories\nAbout my past and that's when it hurts\nBut I need to find for me a lonesome lady type\nWho wants me for self\nA woman who wants me because of Father\nNot for the fame or for my wealth\nSo I can (\nShow her how I feel\n)\nYeah, ladies I'm not that picky\nBut being picky is just for self\nI must protect what I respect\nAnd that is me and not someone else\nI've been mistreated up on the downhill\nBack in the days I used to be strong\nI used to flirt, hurt, kind of jerk\nGet the cash, the sex then I'm gone\nBut payback is a mother\nAnd now I don't know who to trust\nSo I just...\n[Chorus: Jodeci & \nK-Ci\n]\nTreat 'em like they wanna be treated\n(\nThat's all you need to do\n)\nYou should treat 'em right\n[Interlude: Father MC & \nK-Ci\n]\nYeah (\nOoh yeah\n)\nYou know, women, yeah, they tell me I'm lovely and cuddly\n(\nTreat 'em like they wanna be treated\n)\nBut I just don't understand why they want to play with my feelings\n(\nTreat 'em like they wanna be treated\n)\nBut it won't happen again\nNah, never\n(\nNo no no no no, no no no no no, no no no no\n)\n\nSo, listen ladies I'll treat you\nHow you treat me back in return\nI'm not rude, no, I'm not stuck up\nBut my feelings are my main concern\nSo don't think that I'd give in\nBecause now I know how to show\nMy feelings when I get involved\nI'll take it slow before I say \"Oh, no\"\nI'll treat you like you treat me\nI'll be straight loyal and all\nSo don't take advantage of Father\nBecause I'll step, walk but not crawl\nSo, give me what you can give me\nLove, attention, a lot of respect\nI don't ask for a whole lot\nBut I'm gone if you wanna step\nThat's why I like to take it slow\nNot rush because I want more\nThe next time that I fall in love\nHmm, you best I'll be sure\n[Chorus: Jodeci & \nK-Ci\n]\n(\nI'm gonna treat you...\n)\nTreat 'em like they wanna be treated\nYou should treat 'em right\n\nSo ladies, now y'all know how I'm living\nAnd y'all know what I'm about\nAnd that's the end\nSo if you feel you can commit, come and give it a shot\n[Chorus: Jodeci & \nK-Ci\n]\nTreat 'em like they wanna be treated\nYou should treat 'em right\nTreat 'em like they wanna be treated\n(\nI love you, baby\n)\nYou should treat 'em right\n(\nI need you, baby; I gotta have you\n)\n[Outro: K-Ci & \nJoJo\n]\nI need you, baby; I gotta have you\nYes, I do, baby\nEvery hour of the day, every day of the week, baby\nAh yeah, ah yeah\nBaby, yeah; baby, yeah; baby, yeah\nBaby, yeah (\nBaby, yeah\n); baby, yeah (\nBaby, yeah\n); baby, yeah (\nBaby, yeah\n)\nBaby, yeah (\nOh\n), oh oh\nI'm gonna treat you (\nI'm gonna treat you\n)\nI'm gonna treat you (\nI'm gonna love you\n)\nI wanna love you (\nI wanna love you\n)\nEvery day, every hour\nOh baby, ba-b-b-baby, b-b-baby (\nBaby\n)\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nOh yeah (\nTreat 'em like\n)\nTreat 'em like, treat 'em like",
