 "lyrics": "How could I throw away a miracle?\nHow could I face another day?\nIt's all of my doing, I made a choice\nAnd today, I pay\nMy heart is full of pain\nHow could you understand, the way I feel?\nHow could you relate to so much pain?\nSeems as though nothing can comfort me\nSo today, I pray\nThat someone should listen, for\n\nNothing should matter\nNot when love grows inside you\nThe choice is yours\nThere's a miracle in store\nNothing should matter\nNot when love grows inside you\nA voice of love is crying out\nDon't throw love away\nThere's a miracle in store\n\nHow could I let go of a miracle?\nNothing cold ever take its place\nThought I was looking, out for myself\nNow it seems the pain\nIs all that I have gained\nI wonder if I could be your miracle\nI wonder if I could spare you pain\nSeems as though nothing will comfort me\nLord, less today, I pray\nThat you should come listen\n\nNothing should matter\nNot when love grows inside you\nThe choice is yours\nThere's a miracle in store\nNothing should matter\nNot when love grows inside you\nA voice of love is crying out\nDon't throw love away\nThere's a miracle in store\n\nDon't ever throw away your miracle\nDon't let it slip away\nNothing should matter\n\nNothing should matter\nNot when love grows inside you\nThe choice is yours\nThere's a miracle in store\nNothing should matter\nNot when love grows inside you\nA voice of love is crying out\nDon't throw love away\nThere's a miracle in store",
