 "lyrics": "Your lips, your smile, your tenderness, ooh baby\nThe way you walk, I can't resist your style\nWhen I sleep at night, I dream of you, ooh baby\nI wake up wet, thinking of you, ooh baby\n\nHow can a man like me\nConvince a girl like you\nTo be his lover and one and only\nHow can I make you see\nThat I'm the one for you\nAnd nobody does it like me, baby\n\nHey pretty girl\nCan I be your man tonight, baby?\nHey pretty mama\nCan I sleep with you tonight?\nHey, pretty girl when you come to my room tonight\nI'll make you come through the night\n\nYour legs around my waist so tight\nI'll slide down south to taste you right\nYou taste so good to me, oh baby\n\nHow does a man like me\nSeduce a girl like you\nHow can I make you my one and only\nHow can I make you scream\nThere's no one else for you\nAnd nobody does it like me, baby\n\nHey pretty girl\nCan I be your man tonight, baby?\nHey pretty mama\nCan I sleep with you tonight?\n\nThere's a candle that's burning in my heart tonight\nAnd the flame is full of my desire\nAnd I can't help but desire you in my bed tonight\nAnd I'll touch you in the places\nWhere no one's been before\nAnd I'll kiss you in the places\nWhere men sometimes ignore\nAnd I'll take you to a level\nYou've never felt before\nAnd though you won't understand it\nYou'll cry and ask for more\n\nHey pretty girl\nCan I be your man tonight, baby?\nHey pretty mama\nCan I sleep with you tonight?\nHey pretty girl\nCan I be your man tonight, baby?\nHey pretty mama\nCan I sleep with you tonight?\nTonight\nHey pretty girl\nCan I be your man tonight, baby?\nHey pretty mama\nCan I sleep with you tonight?",
