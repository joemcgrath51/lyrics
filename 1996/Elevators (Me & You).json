Toni! Tone!\nLike this, East Point and we gone\n\nMe and you\nYour momma and your cousin, too\nRolling down the strip on Vogues\nComing up, slamming Cadillac doors\nMe and you\nYour momma and your cousin, too\nRolling down the strip on Vogues\nComing up, slamming Cadillac doors\n\nGot stopped at the mall the other day\nHeard a call from the other way that I just came from\nSome nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something \"Hey, man, you remember me from school?\"\n\"No, not really\"\nBut he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly\nAnd he kept asking me, \"What kinda car you drive?\nI know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup hoes\nFrom all them songs that y'all done made\"\nAnd I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had\nTrue, I've got more fans than the average man\nBut not enough loot to last me to the end of the week\nI live by the beat like you live check-to-check\nIf it don't move your feet, then, I don't eat, so we like neck-to-neck\nYes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes\nFrom Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue\n\nMe and you\nYour momma and your cousin, too\nRolling down the strip on Vogues\nComing up, slamming Cadillac doors\nMe and you\nYour momma and your cousin, too\nRolling down the strip on Vogues\nComing up, slamming Cadillac doors\nMe and you\nYour momma and your cousin, too\nRolling down the strip on Vogues\nComing up, slamming Cadillac doors\nMe and you\nYour momma and your cousin, too\nRolling down the strip on Vogues\nComing up, slamming Cadillac doors\nMe and you",
