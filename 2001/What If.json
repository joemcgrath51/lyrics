 "lyrics": "I ran into a friend of yours the other day\nAnd I asked her how you've been\nShe said 'My girl is fine, just bought a house, got a job, real good man'\nI told her I was glad for you, that's wonderful\nBut does she ever ask 'bout me?\n'She says she's happy with her life right now, let her go, let her be.'\n\nAnd I told myself I would but something in my heart just would not let you go\nI just wanna know...\n\nWhat if we were wrong about each other?\nWhat if you were really made for me?\nWhat if we were supposed to be together?\nWould that not mean anything?\nWhat if that was supposed to be my house that you go home to every day?\nHow can you be sure that things are better\nIf you can't be sure your heart ain't still here with me?\nStill wanting me\n\nYour friend asked me if there was someone special in my life that I was seeing\nI told her there was no one in particular\nThere's just I, myself, and me\nI told her that I dream of you quite often\nShe just cut her eyes at me\nShe said you got a home, you're very happy\nSo just stop your meddling\n\nI told her that I won't\nI said things are cool, but I guess I was wrong\nI still can't move on\n\nWhat if we were wrong about each other?\nWhat if you were really made for me?\nWhat if we were supposed to be together?\nWould that not mean anything?\nWhat if that was supposed to be my house that you go home to every day?\nHow can you be sure that things are better\nIf you can't be sure your heart ain't still here with me?\nStill wanting me\n\nNow that could be my car\nThat could be my house\nThat could be my baby boy that you're nursing\nThat could be the trash which I always take out\nThat could be the chair that I love to chill in\nThat could be my food on the table at the end of the day\nHugs and the kisses, all the love we make\nWhat the hell do you expect me to say?\nWhat if it's really supposed to be this way?\nWhat if you're really supposed to be with me?\nOh...\n\nWhat if we were wrong about each other?\nWhat if you were really made for me?\nWhat if we were supposed to be together?\nWould that not mean anything?\nWhat if that was supposed to be my house that you go home to every day?\nHow can you be sure that things are better\nIf you can't be sure your heart ain't still here with me? (Still with me, baby)\nStill wanting me (Still wanting me, baby)\nWhat if we were wrong about each other?\nWhat if you were really made for me?\nWhat if we were supposed to be together?\nWould that not mean anything?\nWhat if that was supposed to be my house that you go home to every day?\nHow can you be sure that things are better\nIf you can't be sure your heart ain't still here with me?\nStill wanting me",
