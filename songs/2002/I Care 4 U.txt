[Intro]
Mmm yeah..
Oh yeah oh..

[Verse 1]
Hey my baby
Why you lookin' so down?
Seems like you need a lovin'
Baby you need a girl like me around
Hey my baby
Tell me why you cry
Here take my hand and (Yeah, mmm)
Wipe those tears from your eyes

[Chorus]
Can I talk to you (Can I talk to you?)
Comfort you
Let you know (Just to let you know)
I care 4 you

Can I talk to you (I wanna talk)
Comfort you (Gotta let you know baby)
Let you know
I care 4 you

[Verse 2]
Hey sexy baby
Why'd your girl leave you in pain?
To let a fine man like you go
She must be insane
Hey sexy baby
There's no need to worry
Oh boy if you call on me
I'll come, I'll come in a hurry

[Chorus]
Can I talk to you (Can I talk to you?)
Comfort you
Let you know (Just to let you know)
I care 4 you

Can I talk to you (I wanna talk)
Comfort you (Gotta let you know baby)
Let you know
I care 4 you

[Bridge]
Hold on (Hold on)
Stay strong (Stay strong)
Press on (For me baby)
I care for you (I care for you)

Hold on (Hold on)
Stay strong (Stay strong)
Press on (For me baby)
I care for you (I care for you)

[Chorus]
Can I talk to you (I, I wanna talk)
Comfort you (I wanna hold you tight, baby)
Let you know (I wanna let you know that-)
I care for you (That I care, for you)
Can I talk to you
