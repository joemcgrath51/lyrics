 "lyrics": "*The lyrics originally uploaded was the lyrics to \"I Don't Want to Do Wrong\" by Gladys Knight & The Pips. Below is the correct lyrics\nGave you the best\nBest years of my life and I\nGave you a woman\nWho stood by your side\nThrough all your ups and downs\nYour rights and all your wrongs\nAnd God knows there were wrongs\nI should've been long gone, but when I\nMade you that promise\nFor better or worse I said I'd\nStand by your side\nI swallowed my pride\nAnd now you're asking me to understand\nAnd I'm telling you I can't\nWhy should Icare about your feelings\nWhen you don't give a damn about mine\nAnd I don't want to know\nI couldn't care less about your feelings\nDon't you know\nYou should've cared about mine\nAnd I don't want to know\nIt really doesn't matter why you're leavin'\nYou should know\nYou're really throwin' away your life\nAnd I won't sympathize\nYou've hurt me for the last time\nGot no more tears to cry\nGave you three hearts\nOne boy and one girl and a\nWoman who loves you\nWe're sittin' here falling apart\nAll through your ins and outs\nYour fears and all your doubts\nAnd God knows there's been doubts\nBut we've given you a home, and you're just\nThrowing it away baby\nAll for some girl born yesterday\nAnd what about your children\nThere is nothing to explain\nBut still you're asking us to understand\nWell I'm telling you we can't\nWhy should we care about your reasons\nWhen you're walking right out of our lives\nSay goodbye\nTo all the love and memories\nOne last time, one good look at all the love\nThat won't be in your life\nSay goodbye\nI hope that you'll be happy\nDon't look back, 'cuz it'll be too late\nI've gone with my life",
