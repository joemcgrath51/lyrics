 "lyrics": "Here I sit outside your door\nTalk to me\nHere I sit outside your door\nTalk to me\n\nHere I am waiting\nJust waiting\nAnticipating a chance to run into you\nI sit here for hours\nOne day I even sat through a rain shower\nFor just a glance\nA chance to talk to you\nYou're probably wondering how I even know you\nFor now you're just my dream\nAnd when I wake up I hope you talk to me\n\nHere I sit outside your door\nTalk to me\n(Talk to me)\nHere I sit outside your door\nTalk to me\n\nI'd be content to just sit here and talk to you\nIn my dreams you love me and me only\nThe way you kiss and hold me\nLove is what I search and search and search to find\nBut until then I'll just dream for the meantime\n\nHere I sit outside your door\nTalk to me\n(Would you talk to me?)\nNo one will ever love you more\nTalk to me\n(Please, just talk to me)\n\nClose your eyes\nTalk to me\nI urge you\n\nHere I sit outside your door\nTalk to me\n(I'd be good to you, I'd be so good to you)\nHere I sit outside your door\n(If we stay here, we could put on some Billie Holiday records)\nTalk to me\nHere I sit outside your door\n(Tell me everything that you feel)\nTalk to me\n(And everything that you need)\n(I just want you you to stay and talk to me)\nNo one will ever love you more\n(I'm just so lonely)\nTalk to me\n(I know but I'm so lonely)\nHere I sit outside your door\n(Close the door and put down the shades)\nHere I sit outside your door\nTalk to me\n(Please stay)\nHere I sit outside your door\nTalk to me\nTalk to me",
