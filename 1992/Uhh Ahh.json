Yes?\n\nThe love I have right next to me\nIs here and always will be\nI'm caressing your body emotionally\nAs you can feel and will see\nWhy can't we go all the way to the top?\nThe fullest extreme\nThe sounds I hear when you're with me\nExpress the way that you feel, girl (As you say)\n\nUh, ah\nUh, ah (Oh, that's it)\nUh, ah\nUh, ah (Oh, don't stop)\n(Oh)\n\nIn a passionate sense, we move in close\nThe love that we share is the same\nI can tell when I reach down deep inside\nYou show it when you call out my name\nSqueezing you tight and holding you close\nIs all I feel inside\nAlthough I try to hold in my love\nIt's something that I just can't hide\n\nUh, ah\nUh, ah\nUh, ah (Yeah)\nUh, ah (Uh, uh, oh)\nUh, ah (Uh, uh)\nUh, ah (Oh-oh)\nUh, ah (Uh, hey)\nUh, ah\n(Ooh)\n\nThe music is low, the lights are dim, there we lie\nPassion overflows with every look in your eyes\nInfatuation, lust, and a lot of love\nSweet caresses, yes, it's good to be as you want\nAnd clench my back, ecstasy fills the air\nAs you kiss on my neck and stroke the back of my hair\nTo hold you tonight, I feel this is my duty\nTo grasp, to hold, to rock that p\u2014\n\nUh, ah (Ooh, ah)\nUh, ah (Give it to me, baby, I'll rub your back)\nUh, ah (As you lay here with me, yeah)\nUh, ah (Oh)\nUh, ah (I want you and I need you)\nUh, ah (Hold on to me, yeah)\nUh, ah (Oh)\nUh, ah (Right now, baby)\nUh, ah (Oh, oh)\nUh, ah (Don't go away, please baby, stay with me)\nUh, ah (Oh, I can do it to you)\nUh, ah (The way that nobody else can, babe)",
