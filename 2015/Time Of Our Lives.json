 "lyrics": "Shallow heart, deep inside\nDig your grave, live your life\nRemember when we stole your mama's car that night\nIn the middle of the summer time\nKnew it was wrong, but it just felt so right\nEverybody was having the time, time of our life\nWe were having the time, time of our life\nWe were getting so\nMolly know when you're getting high\nIt's hard to believe that time has passed us by\nRemember when we stole your mama's car that night\nIn the middle of the summer time\nKnew it was wrong, but it just felt so right\nEverybody was having the time, time of our life\nWe were having the time, the time of our life\nWe were getting so high, out of our mind\nWe were having the time, time of our life\nWe were getting so high\nWish that I could turn back time\nWish that I could be alive\nCan't excel inside my head\nLift you up my wounded friend\nTime of our lives\nWe were getting so high\nOut of our minds\nWe were having the time, time of our life\nWe were having the time, time of our life\nWe were getting so high, out of our mind\nWe were having the time, time of our life\nWish that I could turn back time\nWish that I could be around\nTime, of our life",
