 "lyrics": "I'm for real\n\nI can run, I can race for hours and hours, and don't stop\nI can float, I can fly us to the highest mountain tops\nI can breathe you, I can drink in your laugh\nI can... I can live on your smile\nI can trip and if I can fall into your arms\nI can stay there my whole life\n\nI can live, I can love\nI can be better with you (With you), for real (For real)\nI can hear, I can feel\nI can see, I can tell you are for real (Ooh)\nI can live, I can love\nI can be better with you, for real (For real)\nI can hear, I can feel\nI can see, I can tell you are for real\n\nI can stare, I can memorize\nYour face, your hands, your hair, every part of you\nI can cut off any loose ends and not even wanna keep a few\nI can speak to you so honestly, I can't even run any game\nI can hear a million angels singing in my ears\nWhen I say your name, ooh\n\nI can live, I can love\nI can be better with you, for real\nI can hear, I can feel\nI can see, I can tell you are for real (You're for real)\nI can live, I can love\nI can be better with you (I can be better), for real (For real)\nI can hear, I can feel\nI can see, I can tell you are for real\n(I can tell that you're for real)\n\nI can't smile, can't dream like a child\nCan't feel safe in this wide world without you\nI can't go, can't disturb this flow\nCan't begin to know what I would do\nI can't see, can't find strength to be\nRather not be me without you\nI can't deal, I can't even feel\nWithout you, I'm not real\n\nI can live, I can love\nI can be better with you, for real\nI can hear, I can feel\nI can see, I can tell you are for real\nI can live, I can love\nI can be better with you, for real\nI can hear, I can feel\nI can see, I can tell you are for real\nI can live, I can love\nI can be better with you, for real (For real)\nI can hear, I can feel\nI can see, I can tell you are for real (You are for real)\nI can live, I can love\nI can be better with you, for real\nI can hear, I can feel\nI can see, I can tell you are for real",
