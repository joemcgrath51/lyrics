 "lyrics": "He got older but never grew\nFor his life he can't tell the truth\nHow to love he ain't got a clue\nPlaying games like he'll never lose you\nTry to talk to him can't get through\nEvery day he's a different dude\nThese are the signs of a grown ass boy\nBetter run for the hills I'm just trying to keep it real\n\nYou can't raise a man\nHe's already grown what you gonna do, you wonder why he\nActs like a boy\nIt's cause he wasn't raised right before you\nGirl, you ain't never gonna change nobody\nIf he don't wanna, you can't make nobody\nCause you can't raise a man\n\nComing home any time at night\nExpecting you to let it ride\nHow many tears are you gonna cry?\nPlaying games like he'll never lose you\nYou know that the love is changed\nHow many times he called you out your name?\nThese are the signs of a grown ass boy\nBetter run for the hills I'm just keeping it real\n\nYou can't raise a man\nHe's already grown what you gonna do, you wonder why he\nActs like a boy\nIt's cause he wasn't raised right before you\nGirl, you ain't never gonna change nobody\nIf he don't wanna, you can't make nobody\nCause you can't raise a man\n\nGonna take more than a miracle\nTo change him just let him go\nTell me when will you decide\nTo do better with your life?\nIf his momma couldn't do it, what makes you think\nYou can train a boy to be a man? It's too late\nBetter off letting him go\nNo matter how hard you try, you can't raise\n\nYou can't raise a man\nHe's already grown what you gonna do, you wonder why he\nActs like a boy\nIt's cause he wasn't raised right before you\nGirl, you ain't never gonna change nobody\nIf he don't wanna, you can't make nobody\nCause you can't raise a man",
