Because of a\nTechnical error, my right arm was\nNot frozen.  I was therefore by\nDefinition only partially frozen\nANGLE ON EVIL ASSOCIATE MUSTAFA.  He is terrified and sweaty\nEyes darting left and right\nMUSTAFA\nBut my design was perfect!  Your\nAutonomic functions were shut down\nAnd even though your arm wasn't\nFrozen, the aging was retarded\nTherefore your right arm is only\nSlightly older than the left\nDR. EVIL\nCan't you see I'm only half a man?\nLook at me, I'm a freak!\nHe holds up his older right arm, which looks normal\nMUSTAFA\nBut Dr. Evil, all you need to do\nIs&emdash;\n(holding up tennis\nBall)\n--work with this tennis ball.  Squeeze\nIt for twenty minutes a day.  A few\nMonths of that and it'll be just as\nStrong as the other arm...\nDR. EVIL\nAnd look what you've done to Mr\nBigglesworth!\nANGLE ON MR.

The conference table slowly rotates to\nReveal a large, illuminated map of the United States dotted\nBy various miniature models\nNUMBER TWO\nOver the last thirty years, Virtucon\nHas grown by leaps and bounds.  About\nFifteen years ago, we changed from\nVolatile chemicals to the\nCommunication industry.

EVIL\nGentlemen, I have a plan.  It's called blackmail.  The Royal Family of\nBritain are the wealthiest landowners In the world.  Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.\nThere is an uncomfortable silence\nNUMBER TWO\nUm, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair.  He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.\nDR. EVIL\nPeople have to tell me these things! I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.\n(pausing)\nOK, no problem.  Here's my second plan.  Back in the Sixties I had a\nweather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a \"laser.\"  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the \"Ozone Layer.\"  Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer.  That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.\nThere is another uncomfortable silence\nNUMBER TWO\nUmm, that also has already happened\nDR. EVIL\nRight\n(pause)\nOh, hell, let's just do what we always\nDo.  Let's hijack some nuclear weapons\nAnd hold the world hostage\n(pause)\nGentlemen, it's come to my attention\nThat a breakaway Russian Republic\nCalled Kreplachistan will be\nTransferring a nuclear warhead to\nThe United Nations in a few days\nHere's the plan.  We get the warhead\nAnd we hold the world ransom...\n(dramatic pause)\n...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!\nThere is an uncomfortable pause\nNUMBER TWO\nDon't you think we should ask for\nMore than a million dollars?  A\nMillion dollars isn't that much money\nThese days\nDR. EVIL\nAll right then...\n(dramatic pause)\n...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!\nThere is another uncomfortable pause\nNUMBER TWO\nVirtucon alone makes over nine billion\nDollars a year\nDR. EVIL\n(pleasantly surprised)\nOh, really?\n(slightly irritated)\nOne-hundred billion dollars\n(pause)\nOK, make it happen.  Anything else?\nFRAU FARBISSINA\nRemember when we froze your semen\nYou said that if it looked like you\nWeren't coming back to try and make\nYou a son so that a part of you would\nLive forever?\nDR. EVIL\nYes\nFRAU FARBISSINA\nWell, after a few years, we got sort\nOf impatient.  Dr. Evil, I want you\nTo meet your son\nDR.
