 "lyrics": "\"Any day now,\" is what I kept telling myself\nOn the last mile, on the road to somewhere\nBut along the way I (got stopped by)\nAll the wind and the rain and\nTo my surprise (they knew my name)\n\nAnd it shook my heart\nBlew my mind\nI've had to cry so many nights\nI've had to hold on for my life\nBut all I can say now is that I survived\n\nI survived, I survived, I survived\nI survived, I survived, I survived\nOh, You know I had a lot on me\nTruth be told, it almost broke me\nBut I'm so glad\nI survived, I survived, I survived now\n\nNow hurt and pain were sometimes my company\nSeparated from those, then I suppose\nI didn't have no guarantees\nBut one thing, that I knew for sure was\nThat I've had my share of ups and downs\nI made it even though\n\nOh, it shook my heart\nBlew my mind\nI've had to cry so many nights\nI've had to hold on for my life\nBut all I can say now is that I survived\n\nI survived, I survived, I survived\nI survived, I survived, I survived\nOh, Lord I had a lot on me\nTruth be told, it almost broke me\nBut I'm so glad\nI survived, I survived, I survived now\n\nI know you heard this message before\nI wanna tell you once more\nIt's alright\nI know the road you're on might seem long\nBut I encourage you to hold on, hold on\nYou will survive\nI do believe you will\nBut all I can say now is that I survived\n\nI survived, I survived, I survived\nI survived, I survived, I survived\nOh, You know I had a lot on me\nTruth be told, it almost broke me\nBut I'm so glad\nI survived, I survived, I survived now\n\nWhen the weight of the world's\nAll on your shoulder\nJust remember, remember, remember\nTo keep your head up and survive\n\nOh, You know I had a lot on me\nTruth be told, it almost broke me\nBut I'm so glad\nI survived, I survived, I survived now\nI survived, I survived, I survived\nI survived, I survived, I survived\nOh, You know I had a lot on me\nTruth be told, it almost broke me\nBut I'm so glad\nI survived, I survived, I survived now",
