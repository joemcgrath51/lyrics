 "lyrics": "Talk to me, baby\nI'm listening\n\nLay down, and tell me what's on your mind\nWhat exactly did he do, to make you cry this time?\nWell I will be your comforter, I will make it right\nHe cast a shadow on your heart, and I will bring back your light\n\nCome in, I see he's hurt you again\nWhen you are in pain, I'm in pain, that's part of being a friend\nBut this is a special case, I held my feelings back because of him\nAnd now I can see it more than ever, I made a very big mistake\n\nI don't mean to disregard your feelings, but I think he's a fool\nHe don't know how sensitive you are, and baby that just ain't cool\nI'm just glad I can be there for you, when you need a helping hand\nDeep inside my heart from the start, I know I should've been your man\n\nLay down, and tell me what's on your mind\nWhat exactly did he do, to make you cry this time?\nWell I will be your comforter, I will make it right\nHe cast a shadow on your heart, and I will bring back your light\n\nI will comfort, comfort, comfort you\nI will, I will comfort you\nI will comfort, comfort, comfort you\nI will, I will comfort you\nI will comfort, comfort, comfort you\nI will, I will comfort you\nI will comfort, comfort, comfort you\nI will, I will comfort you\n\nLay down, and tell me what's on your mind\nWhat exactly did he do, to make you cry this time?\nWell I will be your comforter, I will make it right\nHe cast a shadow on your heart, and I will bring back your light",
