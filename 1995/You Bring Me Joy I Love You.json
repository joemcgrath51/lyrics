 "lyrics": "You bring me joy\nWhen I'm down\nOh so much joy\nWhen I lose my way, your love comes smiling on me\nI saw your face and then I knew\nWe would be friends\nI was so afraid but your eyes, they'd say, \"Come to me\"\nSo I'd say to you\n\"Can we talk for a while?\"\nYou'd say \"It's alright\"\nWhen you love me, I smile\nI feel your heart and you feel mine\nYou bring me joy\n\nYou bring me joy\nDon't go too far away\nIf I can't see your face, I will remember your smile\nBut can this be right\nOh, and should we be friends\nI get lonely sometimes\nAnd I'm mixed up again\n'Cause you're the finest thing I've seen in all my life\nYou bring me joy\n\n(My joy) My joy\n\nI believe this is gonna be what you want it to be\nI just love you, I just, I love you, why can't you see\nThat you're the finest thing I've seen in all my life\nYou bring me joy\n\n(My joy) You are, you're my joy\n(My joy) My... (You bring me joy) my joy\nI, thank you, baby, thank you, baby\n(You bring me joy)\nI just love you, baby\nI just love you, baby\nI...I just love you\nWhen I lose my way, your love comes smiling on me",
