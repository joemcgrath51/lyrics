 "lyrics": "I read her letters\nAnd I saw her picture\nAnd I smelled her cheap perfume\nIt must have come from you\nHow could you touch her?\nLay down beside her?\nWell, there just ain't no excuse\nYou shouldn't have been so loose\n\nI saw the telephone bill\nYou must be out of your mind\nIf you think you can smooth it over\nThen you're wasting your time\n\nWell, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget\n'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time\nAnd I guess I can go on although I must admit\nI've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time\n\nYou're such a liar\nYou took her and her children\nOut for the afternoon\nWhile I was sittin' waitin' on you\nHow could you do it?\nYou should've been here with me\nYou just couldn't do it\nYou had to be in the streets\n\nWell, I heard through the grapevine\nYou've been messin' around\nWhen you thought you were gettin' over\nThat's when a baby girl found out\n\nWell, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget\n'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time\n(You really hurt me)\nAnd I guess I can go on although I must admit\nI've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time\n\nI gave my heart, gave my time\nGave my soul 'cause love was blind\nI can't explain this poor excuse\nOf a man, of a boy who was born to lose\nI paid the rent, washed your clothes\nCooked your food and only God knows\nOnly God knows why I stay with you\nI guess (Guess I) I'm in love\n\nWell, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget\n(Oh, baby, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)\n'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time\n(Ooh, you really hurt me this time, baby)\nAnd I guess I can go on although I must admit (Although I must admit)\nI've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time\n(I'm gonna mess around some time)\n\nI gave my heart, gave my time\nGave my soul 'cause love was blind\nI can't explain this poor excuse\nOf a man, of a boy who was born to lose\nI paid the rent, I washed your clothes\nCooked your food and only God knows\nOnly God knows why I stay with you\nI guess I...I'm in love\n\nWell, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget\n'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time\n(Ooh, oh, baby, you hurt me, you hurt me)\nAnd I guess I can go on although I must admit\nI've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time\nWell, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget\n(I'm willin', I'm willin' and able)\n'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time...",
