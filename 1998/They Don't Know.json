You are the only one\nWhen I'm not around, do you think of me?\nOr what the jealous ones are claimin' me to be\nYou should know by now, that it's gonna take\nA lot of trust from you for us to make it through\n\nYou should know, baby, you're my angel\nNothing's gonna make you fall from Heaven\nGirl, I just want to love you, love you\n\nDon't listen to what people say\nThey don't know about-'bout you and me\nPut it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy\nThey don't know about this here\nDon't listen to what people say\nThey don't know about-'bout you and me\nPut it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy\nThey don't know about this here\n\nGirl, lets talk about what your friends told you\nThat I'm a selfish man, want my cake and eat it to\nMaybe in my past but you changed me now\nNow that I've learned to love, it's you that showed me how\nYour love so real I'd be a fool to play\nPlay around on you, I want to stay with you\nYou should know by now that it's gonna take\nA lot of trust from you for us to make it through\n\nYou should know it, you're my angel\nNothing's gonna make you fall from Heaven\nGirl, I just want to love you, love you\n\nDon't listen to what people say\nThey don't know about-'bout you and me\nPut it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy\nThey don't know about this here\nDon't listen to what people say\nThey don't know about-'bout you and me\nPut it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy\nThey don't know about this here\nDon't listen to what people say\nThey don't know about-'bout you and me\nPut it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy\nThey don't know about this here\nDon't listen to what people say\nThey don't know about-'bout you and me\nPut it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy\nThey don't know about this here\n\nYou're my angel (Yeah, yeah)\nI want you, baby, to stay with me\nI won't let you down, you'll see, babe\nYou'll see it\n\nDon't listen to what people say\nThey don't know about-'bout you and me\nPut it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy\nThey don't know about this here\nDon't listen to what people say\nThey don't know about-'bout you and me\nPut it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy\nThey don't know about this here\nDon't listen to what people say\nThey don't know about-'bout you and me\nPut it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy\nThey don't know about this here\nDon't listen to what people say",
