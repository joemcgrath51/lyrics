(uh)\nDid you read my love letter? (yeah)\nDid it touch your heart? (yeah baby)\nWhen you read my love letter\n(when you read my love letter)\n\nWeekends and birthdays\nCelebration, holidays\nLove making history\nA toast to our victories\nSweet dreams, butterflies\nHolding hands, side by side\nBest friends, families\nReminds me\n\nDid you get my card? (my card)\n(did you get my card girl?)\nDid you read my love letter?\n(tell me did you read my love letter?)\nDid it touch your heart?\n(did it touch your heart?)\nWhen you read my love letter\n(when you read my love letter, babe)\n\nCocktails, happy hours\nWedding bells, baby showers\nVacations, sailboats\nWith the ones you love the most\nLong time no see\nBack together you and me\nWrite me back when you receive this here\n\nDid you get my card? (yeah)\n(did you get my card?)\nDid you read my love letter?\n(did you read my love letter?)\nDid it touch your heart?\n(tell me, did it touch your heart?)\nWhen you read my love letter\n(girl, when you read my love letter)\n\nI hope these\nHope these words find you in the perfect mood\nI wrote this letter according to my love for you\nSo I hope this paper will travel safely to where you are\nBecause the melody is custom made for your heart\nThough near or far I will find a way to send my love\nOnly pray that it don\u2019t come back return to sender\nIf you are reading this I hope that things are well\nAnd you can text me back, you can write me back\nJust check your mail\n\nDid you get my card?\n(did you get my card, yeah?)\nDid you read my love letter?\n(girl tell me)\nDid it touch your heart?\n(when you read)\nWhen you read my love letter\n(my love, my love)\n\nDid you get my card?\n(did it make you smile, yeah?)\nDid you read my love letter?\n(did it lift you up, yeah?)\nDid it touch your heart?\n(did it make you wanna write me back, baby?)\nWhen you read my love letter\n(when you got my love letter)\n\nAll the ladies sing for me\nDo do do do do do\nDo do do do\nYeah yeah yeah yeah\nLadies sing\nLa la la la la la\nLa la la la",
