 "lyrics": "Mmm, alright\n\nGrowin' up, it was tough\nWe were glad for what little we had\nI saw my share of old fair, Mississippi\nDirt roads and Confederate flags\nEveryday my father would tell me\n\"Son, run and don't never come back\"\nThat's where I left my girl\nThat's where my heart is at, and ohh\n\nI held my breath when they dipped my head\nThen I came up shiny and new\nFound out about love in the back of my Impala\nWhen they laid my grandfather too\nDown by the river, where black folks gather\nAfter Sunday service is through\nHow the river runs to the ocean\nI'll be runnin' right back to you (runnin' back to you)\n\nI got along, I'm movin' on\nI bandaged the scars up well\nI think of her, then I sit and I wait\nFor a card or a letter in the mail\nI walk the beach with the sand in my feet\nPlace my ear up to a shell\nI wonder if you miss me, too\n'Cause I been longin' to get to you\nI'm sick of starin' out my window sill\nI'm tired of hopin' she remembers me still\nI'm packin' my bags, I said I'm goin' back home\nTo the place where I belong\nThe river, and if she's there when I get there\nI'm never gonna leave her again\nYou see, she stole my heart\nDown by the river\n\nI held my breath when they dipped my head\nThen I came up shiny and new\nFound out about love in the back of my Impala\nWhen they laid my grandfather too\nDown by the river, where black folks gather\nAfter Sunday service is through\nHow the river runs to the ocean\nI'll be runnin' right back to you (runnin' back to you)\n\n(Ohh) So I'm packin' up my suitcase\n(Ohh) Bought me a one-way fare\n(Ohh) I'm leavin' everything behind me\n(Ohh-a-ohh) But in my heart I always care\nAnd I'll still be right there\nThank you, baby\n'Cause nothin' can replace that part in my life, and oh\n\nI held my breath when they dipped my head\nThen I came up shiny and new\nFound out about love in the back of my Impala\nWhen they laid my grandfather too\nDown by the river, where black folks gather\nAfter Sunday service is through\nHow the river runs to the ocean\nI'll be runnin' right back to you (runnin' back to you)",
