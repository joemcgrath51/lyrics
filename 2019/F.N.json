If you mention my name\nBoy, I promise I'ma kill you, better duck, nigga\nWhat's up with you? I grew up with you\nUsed to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you\nI used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you\nFuck niggas, I don't trust niggas\nIf you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga\nHow you tell on the gang? If you mention my name\nBoy, I promise I'ma kill you, better duck, nigga\nWhat's up with you? I grew up with you\nUsed to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you\nI used to fuck with you, and now I'm wishing that a bus hit you\n\nLil Tjay\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nOh",
