 "lyrics": "A tornado flew around my room before you came\nExcuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in\nSouthern California, much like Arizona\nMy eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they pour when\n\nI'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no\nI've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know\nI've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?\nDo ya, do ya?\n\nOr do you not think so far ahead?\n'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh\nOr do you not think so far ahead?\n'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh\n\nNo, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it\nGot a beach house I could sell you in Idaho\nSince you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute\nThat's why I kissed you\nGot a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down\n\nThinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no\nI've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know\nI've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?\nDo ya, do ya?\n\nOr do you not think so far ahead?\n'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh\nOr do you not think so far ahead?\n'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh\n\nYes, of course, I remember, how could I forget (How could I forget?) how you feel? (How you feel)\nYou know you were my first time, a new feel\nIt won't ever get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive\nWe'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white\n\nOr do you not think so far ahead?\n'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh\nOr do you not think so far ahead?\n'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh",
