I'm goin' hard (Hard, yeah)\nI pop bubbly in your memory\nYou should be glad I'm showin' you sympathy (Showin' you sympathy)\nI gave you real love out the gutter (Out the gutter)\nEver let you go, you gon' suffer (You gon' suffer from it)\n\nI come through with strippers and some shottas (Shottas)\nI gotta accept that I'm a monster\nI pull up in several different options\nNot all, but most of 'em came topless\nI'll shatter your dreams with this cream I make (Cream I make)\nGotta be on codeine to think of shit I say (Shit I say)\nI can't feel my toes and ain't gon' fold up (Fold up)\nI was in the double R when I rolled up (When I rolled up)\n\nYeah, L-O-V-E on my right leg\nNah Hendrix overload, dig what I'm sayin'?\nI feel like I should be giving up\nYou can leave if it's too much\nBut I'm tired of you leading me on, oh no\nI don't like where this shit is going\nI mean I've been stuck in all your apologies\nGave my all but you want more from me\nKeep your love, it doesn't feel the same\nI hope it hurts you when you're hearin' my name",
