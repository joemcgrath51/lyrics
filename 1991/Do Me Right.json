Don't you recognize my voice, honey bun?\nOh, I understand, you were half-sleep\nNow wait a minute, who's beeper just beeped?\nI know it ain't mine, mine's is on my hip\nNow tell me you didn't flip on the honey dipped, ya pocket trip\nIt's time to get your heart broke, honey, I smell smoke\nYou thought he was dope, so you took a toke\nSo here's the news, I'm ghost, I'm outta here, long gone\nThe lover went left, so, honey, you stay strong\nAnd when you wake up in the middle of the night\nI'll be with her 'cause she, she'll do me right\n\n(Do me right) Do me right\n(Be my girl)\n\nDo me right\n(Do me right, I just wanna be your man) Oh\n(I want you to be my girl) Yeah, baby\n(Why don't you just do me right?) Promise I would do different things for you\n(Do me right, I just wanna be your man) Please, baby\n(I want you to be my girl) Be my girl\n(Why don't you just do me right?) I don't want nobody else\n(Do me right, I just wanna be your man) I've got to have your love right now\n(I want you to be my girl)\n(Why don't you just do me right?)
