 "lyrics": "Call, call my name\nCall it, call my name\n\nI've heard your voice this morning\nCalling out my name\nIt had been so long, since I've heard\nThat it didn't really sound quite the same, no\nBut it let me know that my name\nHad never really been spoken before\nBefore the day I carried you\nThrough the bridal path door\nAnd ever since that day I haven't wanted anyone but you\nAnd anybody who really knows me knows the truth\nThat I\n\nI just can't stop writing songs about you\nI love you so much\nI just can't wait to get my arms around you\nAnd feel your touch\nIf I don't see you real soon, baby girl\nI might go insane\nI know it's only been three hours\nBut I love it when you call my name, yes I do\n\nI heard a voice on the news saying\nPeople wanna stop the war (stop the war)\nIf they had a love as sweet as you\nThey'd forget what they were fighting for\nWhat's the matter with the world today?\nThe land of the free, somebody lied\nThey can bug my phone and peep around my home\nThey'll only see you and me making love inside\n\nI just can't stop writing songs about you\nI love you so much\nI just can't wait to get my arms around you\nAnd feel your touch\nIf I don't see you real soon, baby girl\nI might go insane\nI know it's only been three hours\nBut I love it when you call my name, yes I do\n\nI never seen the moon look so lovely\nAs the night I saw it with you\nLet me know I'd never seen the moon before\nSo many speak of the moon\nAs though it had no flaws\nBut to compare it to a beauty like yours\nWould give one pause\nNothing about you is false\nThat's why your love is real\nThat's why your love is real love\nGod forbid if you belonged to another\nI'd have to steal you\nI'd have to take you from your man\nI might be tempted to break the law 'round here\nBecause your beauty it gives one pause\nIt slows me down\n\nI just can't stop writing songs about you\nI love you so much\nI just can't wait to get my arms around you\nAnd feel your touch\nIf I don't see you real soon, baby girl\nI might go insane, right\nI know it's only been three hours\nBut I love it when you call my name, yes I do\n\nI love it when you call my name\nCall, call my name\nCall it, call my name",
