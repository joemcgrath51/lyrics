Open your mouth\n\nI say, mama, I'm so sorry\nI got ice burned where my heart at\nOn the road where I had it hard at\nHow I'm chosen? I'm so heartless, so, so heartless\nI ain't know my age, he was 16, they killed Lil Dave\nMind in a rage, I'm way too young to feel this pain\nI ain't know how to fade, but I dove in 'cause I'm a man\nI love that girl to death, as we get old, our feelings change\nI pay for therapy because my thoughts ahead of me\nThey keep on draggin' me, I play for keeps, they scared of me\nI cannot barely, can barely sleep or even breathe\nI cannot hold on without you on side of me\nI never knew this fame would take the ones I love from \u2018way from me\nI wanna see Kacey bad, but I can't seem to call Nene\nGo in with no pen and pad, I got this shit right on my sleeve\nRight now my candle burning wax, I'm feelin' like it's burnin' me\n\nI'm just a lonely child\nWho wants someone to help him out, oh, oh, ah, ah\nTake this pain away, this pain away\nBecause my head been runnin' wild, wild\n\nI fell in love with Kaylyn, without even knowin' this bitch done snaked me\nI'm missin' Yaya daily, the one who don't make me feel basic\nHappiness I'm chasin', while killers behind me tryna blank me\nYou don't know what I'm feelin'\nOr what I'm thinkin' and you can't change me\nI miss my fuckin' daddy, I've been callin' Montana my father\nTimes been gettin' harder\nI came from nothing, now bitch, I'm royal\nI call Monique my mama, but Lord knows I need Sheronda\nI don't need no commas, I'm feeling like I'm going under\nMy paw-paw getting old, and once he gone, I'm on my own\nRight now I'm all alone, I pray that grandmom keep me strong\nCan't even leave my home, my bracelet beeping plus I'm down\nI just wan' be gone, my son straight, my money long\nTell me what you feelin', I hope that I can help you out\nMy youngins in that North, I pray that y'all gon' make it out\nThese bitches comin' 'round, and they don't even like my songs\nI'll burn up the town, before them niggas bust my dome\nI wish that I can hear Dump say, \"What up, lil brother,\" one more time\nWe killing shit and plus we dying\nI'm gon' go off behind my brother, fuck this charge, I slang that iron\nBefore he go and I don't ride\n\nI'm just a lonely child\nWho wants someone to help him out, oh, oh, ah, ah\nTake this pain away, this pain away\nBecause my head been runnin' wild, wild\nI'm just a lonely child\nWho need someone to help him out, oh, oh, ah, ah\nTake this pain away, my pain away\nBecause my thoughts been runnin' wild\n\nOh, oh Lord\nI need some help because my life been real hard\nThe way I approached the game, it seem that I'm hard\nBut I got feelings too just like a lil' boy, oh Lord\nI'm a grandmom baby",
