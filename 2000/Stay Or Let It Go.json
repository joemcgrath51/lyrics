(Let it go)\nDon't know if we're meant to be\nAnd if we should be can you live faithfully\nGirl, can you tell me, I don't know\nShould I stay or let it go?\n\nBaby, time and time again I tried to overlook the pain\nCouldn't think of losing all we had to gain (All we had to gain)\nGirl, if it takes me losing you for happiness in me\nI think that I might just have to let you go\nDon't know\n\nSo you like playin' those games, huh?\nI'ma see how you do when I walk out the door\nI'm out\n\nDon't know if we will last\nAnd if we do last, can I erase the past?\nGirl, can you tell me, I don't know\nShould I stay or let it go?\n(Should I stay or should I go?)\nDon't know if we're meant to be\nAnd if we should be, can you live faithfully?\nGirl, can you tell me, I don't know (I don't know)\nShould I stay or let it go?\nDon't know if we will last\nAnd if we do last, can I erase the past?\nGirl, can you tell me, I don't know\nShould I stay or let it go?\n(Stay or should I go?)\nDon't know if we're meant to be\nAnd if we should be, can you live faithfully?\nGirl, can you tell me, I don't know\nShould I stay or let it go?\n\nShould I stay, or should I go?\nShould I stay, or should I go?",
