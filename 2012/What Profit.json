 "lyrics": "My man was steady stacking chips, riding in the classy whips\nLiving every day like his birthday\nAnd house gotta door with the door man\nBut it seems that your man forgot what you need in the worst way\nIs to be loved, from the top of your head\nDown to your pretty pedicure toes, whoa\nYou wanna be loved, it's the thing that last long\nAfter all the money comes and goes\nWhat profit a man, to gain the whole wide world\nTo lose his girl, lose his girl\nIf I was your man, I'd do all that I can to keep you girl\nWhat profit a man\nLately when he took you out\nMostly all he talked about were things that meant little to you, babe\nHollywod had him gone, he forgot what turned you on\nAlmost as if he never knew you\nNeeded to be loved, from deep inside of your mind\nDown to the depths of your soul, oh\nYou wanna be loved\nYou see love lasts long, after all the money comes and goes\nWhat profit a man, to gain the whole wide world\nTo lose his girl, lose his girl. hey it means nothing in life unless I got you\nIf I was your man, I'd do all that I can to keep you girl\nYeah, I'd do what I can, what profit a man\nTo get these material things, and turn around and lose your queen\nThe one who was there, ridin' for you when it was all just a dream\nHow you gonna get brand new\nWith the only girl who ever loved you, ooh baby\nWhat profit a man, to gain the whole wide world\nTo lose his girl, lose his girl, hey I'd rather not lose you baby\nIf I was your man, I'd do all that I can to keep you girl\nJust to keep you, what profit a man\nWhat profit a man, to gain the whole wide world\nTo lose his girl, I'd rather lose everything than lose you\nIf I was your man, I'd do all that I can to keep you girl\nWhat profit a man",
