(yeah)\nI said fellas (yeah)\nAre y'all with me? (yeah)\nWhy don't you tell the girls what y'all wanna do\nYa wanna (oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ew)\nThat's right yo and I'm in the flow\nSo pump up the volume along with the tempo\nI want everybody in the house to know\nI came here tonight to hear the crowd go\n]\n\nYeah\nBreak it on DOWN, uh\nYeah, give 'em it\nUh, bring it back to 'em\nYeah, c'mon now\n - w/ ad libs\n\"Mix\" - repeated\n\n\n\nHere I go\nThe F-f-f-f-Fresh P-p-p-p-Prince is who I am\nSo tell my mother that I never make a whack jam\nBut sometimes I get n-nervous and start to stutter\nAnd I f-fumble every word, for word I utter\nSo I just try to ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chill\nBut it gets worse-a but worse-a but-but-but worse still\nI need the c-c-c-crowd to k-k-k-kick into it\nThey help me calm down and I can get through it\nSo higher higher, get your hands to the ceiling\nLet it go y'all don't fight the feeling\nMic in a strangle hold, sweat pouring\nAnd like Jordan yo I'm scoring\nYeah that's right y'all and I am in the flow\nSo pump up the volume, along with the tempo\nMany have died trying to stop my show\nI came here tonight to here the crowd go\n]\n\nYeah, uh\nKick it to 'em right here\nDon't stop\nAll night long\nAnd I'm outta here",
