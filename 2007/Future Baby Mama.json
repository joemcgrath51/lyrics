 "lyrics": "I've heard it said my lovers look alike\nCould it be that I was looking for you?\nThey were cool, but something wasn't right\nThey had me fooled for a minute and then I saw the truth\n\nNone of them got what it takes\nTo be a future baby mama\nGotta bend in the wind, but don't break\nTo keep your man\nShow me one of them and I'll make her mine\nWith no more drama\nFuture baby mama\n\nI've heard it said I won't treat you right\n(You know that ain't right)\nBut they ain't sure, 'cause they don't know nothing about you\n(You know you want me)\nYou're too secure to ever wanna fuss and fight\n(That's right)\nThat's why your man never ever got a reason to doubt you\n\nNone of them got what it takes\nTo be a future baby mama, hey\nGotta bend in the wind, but don't break\nTo keep your man, hey hey hey\nShow me one of them and I'll make her mine\nWith no more drama\nFuture baby mama\n\nYeah, I know you might be fine, but I've seen it all before\nCinderella was a waste of time and, oops, she's out the door\nTo build a house together, the thing that matters more\nIs under the floor\nA strong foundation that lasts forever more\n\nI want to make you happy, baby (Oh, yes)\nHappier than happy itself (Oh, yes)\nYou know what?\nIf you'll ever need a hand, call me I'll help\n'Cause I got you, anywhere you wanna go, uh huh (Oh yes)\nParis, London, Africa, San Lucas Mexico, you see\nI know what you want ( know, I know)\nWhat every good woman wants\nA man so in love with you\nHe can't help but to flaunt you\nDeep down I know what you want\nYou want your girlfriends to hate you\n'Cause they can't get your man\n\nNone of them got what it takes\nTo be a future baby mama\nGotta bend in the wind, but don't break\nTo keep your man\nShow me one of them and I'll make her mine\nWith no more drama\nFuture baby mama, well well\nFuture baby mama\nFuture baby mama\nBaby mama\nBaby mama",
