Yeah, I guess that's fine\nBut thai is the sky when you talkin' about mines\nNow my thai got a friend named Gin\nGot me all straight now my dick won't bend\nNow I'm fucked for the rest of the night\nUnless I find a piece of ass whether it's loose or tight\nNow looka here looka here I done found a bitch\nYummy for the dick, Jelly mix in the switch\nSave that shit cuz I don't wanna be your man\nJust need a little loosin', do you understand?\n\nMy mind's fucked up off chocolate thai\nHit the gin shop now I'm so high\nNow I need a bitch that's proper and fly\nSo break me off a piece of that sweet potato pie\n\nThinkin' about what I'm gonna do today\nParty at my homies bout eight\nI thought about goin' to the movies\nBut ain't nothin' like a bunch of proper ass hoochies\nDressed like a player can't wear nothin' less\nSome simple ass shit, even if it ain't Guess\nTake  a couple of shots and now I roll to the spot\nBitches straight peepin' wanna know what I got, well\nOne, two, three, Here comes the D\nPass me the buddah, OOOOH WEEE!!!!\nAnd now I'm ready for you bitches\nSo gang a dick licker, do you get the picture?\nAnd so much love for ya gals\nAnd peace, love, and pussy to my muthafuckin' pals\nAnd ay, yai, yai, I'mma stay high\nAnd keep me a piece of that sweet potato pie\n\n\nThe fellas wanna have a barbecue tonight, I think it's on about five\nThey say it's gonna have plenty Daisy Dukes\n, and Les says it's gonna be live\nSo Imma gonna grab me a player suit, cuz ain't a damn thing changed\nAnd now I'm proper and fly and shit, but man do I feel strange\nSo Imma go down to the liquor store, and find my friend named Gin\nAnd go to the girl with the flyest thai, and break her off a proper twin\nAnd now it's time to make some shit, and look for the proper mix\nAnd run a little game on the PYT,\n and tell it to her somethin' like this",
