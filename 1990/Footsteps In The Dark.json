Hey, hey\nLet's\u2005talk about the distractions goin' on\u2005elsewhere\n\nI keep hearin' footsteps baby\nIn the dark, in the dark\nWhy? I keep hearin' footsteps baby\nIn the dark, in the dark\n\nMy mind drifts now and then\nLookin' down dark corridors and wonders what might have been\nSomething's up ahead\nHey, should I keep this same direction or go back instead?\n\nI keep hearin' footsteps baby\nIn the dark, in the dark\nWhy? I keep hearin' footsteps baby\nIn the dark, in the dark\n\nHoney, now let's stop walkin' around\nWhen there's love lost to be found\nOh, and you know I still care, I still care\nWhat's the sense in goin' elsewhere?\n\nWho feels really sure?\nCan that feelin' guarantee your happiness shall endure?\nAnd do we, really care? Hey, hey\nLet's look at what's been happenin' and try to be more aware\n\nI keep hearin' footsteps baby\nIn the dark, in the dark\nWhy? I keep hearin' footsteps baby\nIn the dark, in the dark\n\nYeah, let's stop walkin' around\nWell when there's love lost, lost to be found\nHoney, you know I still care, I still care\nWhat's the sense in goin', goin' elsewhere?\n\nOh honey, let's stop walkin' around and around and around\nWhen there's no love to be found\nBaby, you know, I still care, I still care\nWhat's the sense of goin', goin' elsewhere?",
