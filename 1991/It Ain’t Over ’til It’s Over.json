 "lyrics": "Here we are still together\nWe are one\nSo much time wasted\nPlaying games with love\n\nSo many tears I've cried\nSo much pain inside\nBut baby It ain't over until it's over\nSo many years we've tried\nTo keep our love alive\nBut baby it ain't over until it's over\n\nHow many times\nDid we give up\nBut we always worked things out\nAnd all my doubts and fears\nKept me wondering, yeah\nIf I'd always, always be in love\n\nSo many tears I've cried\nSo much pain inside\nBut baby It ain't over until it's over\nSo many years we've tried\nAnd kept our love alive\nBut baby it ain't over until it's over\n\n\nSo many tears I've cried\nSo much pain inside\nBut baby It ain't over until it's over\nSo many years we've tried\nAnd kept our love alive\n'Cause baby it ain't over until it's over\nSo many tears I've cried\nSo much pain inside\nBut baby It ain't over until it's over\nSo many years we've tried\nTo keep our love alive\n'Cause baby it ain't over until it's over\n(Over, over, over)\nSo many tears we've cried\nSo much pain inside\nBut baby It ain't over until it's over\nSo many years we've tried\nTo keep our love alive\n'Cause baby it ain't over until it's over\n(Over, over, over, over)\n\nSo many tears we've cried\nSo much pain inside\nBaby It ain't over until it's over\nOver",
