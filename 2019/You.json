Me or the money, what you loyal to?\nHuh, I gave you my loyalty\nMade you royalty and royalties\nTook care of these niggas' lawyer fees\nAnd this is how niggas rewarded me, damn\n\nOoooh, I love you so\nBut why I love you, I'll never know\n(Ooooh, I love you so\nBut why I love you, I'll never know)\n\nBussin\u2019 at me, b-b-b-bussin\u2019 at me\nBut I\u2019m bulletproof, bitch, you can\u2019t get nothin\u2019 past me\nGot body armor\nA nigga gotta watch the throne\nAnd I\u2019m bussin\u2019 back\nSo niggas in a glass house should not throw stones\nWhat do you do when the love turns to hate?\nGotta separate from these fuckin' fakes\nCaesar didn\u2019t see it so he ceased to exist\nSo the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit\nAm I my brother\u2019s keeper?\nOnly if that nigga don\u2019t creep up\nGot a pistol under my pillow\nI\u2019ve never been a deep sleeper\nP-p-p-paranoia, 'cause the nigga that said he\u2019ll\nBlast for ya is now blastin' for ya\nThat\u2019s an assassin for ya\nThese niggas got a shot, they\u2019ll shoot\nPlease Lord, forgive him\nFor these niggas not know what they do, ooh",
