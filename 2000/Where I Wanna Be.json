 "lyrics": "I just left my baby girl a message\nSayin' I won't be coming home\nI'd rather be alone\nShe doesn't fully understand me\nCause I'd rather leave than to cheat\nIf she gives me some time\nI can be the man she needs\nBut there's a lot of lust inside of me\nAnd we've been together since our teenage years\nI really don't mean to hurt her, but I need some time\nTo be alone\n\nBut when you love someone\nYou just don't treat them bad\nOh, how I feel so sad\nNow that I wanna leave\nShe's crying her heart to me\nHow could you let this be?\nI just need time to see\nWhere I wanna be\nWhere I wanna be...\nSweet little dee-do-dee-dee...\nI don't mean to hurt you, baby, oh, no, no...\n\nNever did I imagine\nThat you would play a major part\nIn a decision that's so hard\nDo I leave, do I stay, do I go?\nOr think about my life and what matters to me the most\nGirl, the love that we share is real\nBut in time your heart will heal\nI'm not saying I'm gone, but I\nHave to find what life is like\nWithout you\n\nBut when you love someone\nYou just don't treat them bad\nOh, how I feel so sad\nNow that I wanna leave\nShe's crying her heart to me\nHow could you let this be?\nI just need time to see\nWhere I wanna be\nWhere I wanna be...\nSweet little dee-do-dee-dee...\nI don't mean to hurt you, baby\n\nSee when you love someone\nYou just don't treat them bad\nOh, how I feel so sad\nNow that I wanna leave\nShe's crying her heart to me\nHow could you let this be?\nAnd I just need time to see\nWhere I wanna be\n\nSee when you love someone\nYou just don't treat them bad\nOh, how I feel so sad\nNow that I wanna leave\nShe's crying her heart to me\nHow could you let this be?\nAnd I just need time to see\nWhere I wanna be\n\nSee when you love someone\nYou just don't treat them bad\nOh, how I feel so sad\nNow that I wanna leave\nAnd she's crying her heart to me\nHow could you let this be?\nAnd I just need time to see\nWhere I wanna be\nWhere I wanna be...\n\nI'm Sorry Baby",
