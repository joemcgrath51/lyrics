 "lyrics": "Love, let's talk about love\nIs it anything and everything you hoped for?\nOr do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)\nI know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)\n\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\n\nTell me what you gon' do to me\nConfrontation ain't nothin' new to me\nYou can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue\nBut you can't bring the truth to me\nFuck you and all your expectations\nI don't even want your congratulations\nI recognize your false confidence\nAnd calculated promises all in your conversation\nI hate people that feel entitled\nLook at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you\nOh, you important?\nYou the moral to the story? You endorsin'?\nMothafucka, I don't even like you\nCorrupted man's heart with a gift\nThat's how you find out who you dealin' with\nA small percentage who I'm buildin' with\nI want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'\nOn my momma, that's the realest shit\n\nLove, let's talk about love\nIs it anything and everything you hoped for?\nOr do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)\nI know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)\n\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\n\nIt's getting cold when an ego gets to talkin'\nI get involved, like a rebound\nNo control, no, I'm switched in the way that you bringin' me down\nIt's a turn on, you didn't wait from me\nLeave me alone, keep away from me\nAnd it sounds wrong, get it away from me, yeah\nI just cry for no reason\nI just pray for no reason\nI just think for the life, for the days\nFor the hours and another like breathin'\nI did it all 'cause it feel good\nYou'd leave it all if it feel bad\nBetter live your life, we were runnin' out of time\n\nLove, let's talk about love\nIs it anything and everything you hoped for?\nOr do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)\nI know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)\n\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer\nAll the stars are closer",
