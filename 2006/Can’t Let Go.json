 "lyrics": "No matter what the people say\nI can't, I can't let go\nNo, no\n(Verse: 1)\nWhy must they try to tear down my house when they know it's made from love\nAnd they could never stand in our way\nWe made a vow to love through it all\nWe are one\nAnd no one has the right to tear my love down\n(Chorus)\nNo matter what the people say, I'm gonna love you anyway\nYou are my life, I can't let go\nEven if we fuss or fight, try til we get it right\nYou are my life, I can't let go\nEven if we disagree, you can put it all on me\nYou are my life, I can't let go\nI can't, I can't let you go\n(Verse: 2)\nHow dare they say\nThat a love like ours won't last?\nGod made no mistakes\nWhen He sheltered me with your heart\nThere's no safer place than to be in love\nAnd here I will stand\nAnd there ain't never\nAin't gonna never ever leave you alone\n(Chorus)\nNo matter what the people say I'm gonna love you anyway\nYou are my life, I can't let go\nEven if we fuss or fight, try til we get it right\nYou are my life, I can't let go\nEven if we disagree, you can put it all on me\nYou are my life, I can't let ya' go\nI can't, I can't let you go\n(Bridge)\nAll that I know now is to give you all of me\nAnd no matter how long I take\nAnd every part of me belongs to your love\nHelp me, help me\n(Chorus)\nNo matter what the people say, I'm gonna love you anyway\nYou are my life, I can't let go\nEven if we fuss or fight, try til we get it right\nYou are my life, I can't let go\nEven if we disagree, you can put it all on me\nYou are my life, I can't let go\nI can't, I can't let you go\nNo matter what the people say...",
