 "lyrics": "You can never tell what's in a man's mind\nAnd if he's from Harlem there's no use of even trying\nJust like the tide his mind comes and goes\nLike March weather when he'll change\nNobody knows, nobody knows\nThe man I love, well, he just turned me down, he's a Harlem brown\nOff' times I wish that I were in this ground, six feet underground\nHe idolized me as no other could, no no\nThen he surprised me leaving me a note saying he's\nGone for good\nAnd since my sweetie left me, Harlem, well it ain't the same old place\nThough a thousand dandies smile right in my face\nI think I'll mooch some homemade hooch and go out for a lark\nJust to drive off this mean ole Harlem blues\nYou can have your Broadway give me Lenox Avenue\nAngels from the sky stroll 7th and for that thanks are due\nFrom Madame Walker's beauty shops to Poro System too\nThat make those girls angels without any doubt\nThere are some spots up in Harlem were I'm told it's sudden death\nTo let somebody see you even stop to catch your breath\nIf you've never been to Harlem then I'll guess you'll never know\nThe power of these mean ole Harlem blues\nAh there's one sweet spot in Harlem known as Strivers' Row\nDicty folk some call 'em, one thing you should know\nIs that I have a friend who lives there, I know he won't refuse\nTo put some music to my troubles and call 'em Harlem blues\nAnd since my sweetie left me, Harlem, well it ain't the same old place\nThough a thousand dandies smile right in my face\nI think I'll mooch some homemade hooch and go out for a lark\nJust to drive off these mean mean ole Harlem blues\nAh there's one sweet spot in Harlem known as Strivers' Row\nDicty folk some call 'em, one thing you should know\nIs that I have a friend who lives there, I know he won't refuse\nTo put some music to my troubles and call 'em Harlem blues\nTo put some music to my troubles and call them the Harlem blues\nHarlem, the Harlem blues\nHarlem, the Harlem blues",
