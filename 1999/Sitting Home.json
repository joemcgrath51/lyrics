 "lyrics": "Sittin home waitin for you\n'Cause staring at these walls is all I do\nI try my best to be good to you\nBut your never around when Im in the mood\n\nIm gettin tired being tired your ways\nYou haven't come home or even call me today\nYou dont know the pain when Im being alone\nIm callin out your name when your not even home\n\nCause I need you with me babe\nCan't see you leaving me babe\nCause I dont know no other road I would go\nAnd I hope your feelings change come bring your lovin back to me\nSo I can give you what you need and much more\nOh, until then...\n\n\nAll my friends think that I am a fool\nAnd since you have been gone Ive been thinkin so too\nJust tell me what is it and what you feel I do wrong\nWe should stay together cause our love is so strong\n\n\nBy myself all day long\nThese feeling that I feel for you feel so strong\nBy myself all day long\nThese feeling that I feel for you since you been gone\nChorus",
