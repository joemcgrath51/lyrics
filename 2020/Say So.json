Say so\nDay to night to morning, keep with me in the moment\nI'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?\nDidn't even notice, no punches left to roll with\nYou got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so\n\nIt's been a long time since you fell in love\nYou ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself\nTell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)\n'Cause luckily I'm good at reading\nI wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'\nAnd we can dance all day around it\nIf you frontin', I'll be bouncing\nIf you want it, scream it, shout it, babe\nBefore I leave you dry\n\nDay to night to morning, keep with me in the moment\nI'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?\nDidn't even notice, no punches left to roll with\nYou got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so\nDay to night to morning, keep with me in the moment\nI'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?\nDidn't even notice, no punches left to roll with\nYou got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Yeah)\n\nLet me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)\nHe ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)\nHe ain't ever even been impressed like this\nProlly why I got him quiet on the set like zip\nLike it, love it, need it, bad\nTake it, own it, steal it, fast\nBoy, stop playing, grab my ass\nWhy you actin' like you shy? (Hot)\nShut it, save it, keep it pushin'\nWhy you beating 'round the bush?\nKnowin' you want all this woman\nNever knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)\nAll of them bitches hating I have you with me\nAll of my niggas sayin' you mad committed\nRealer than anybody you had, and pretty\nAll of the body-ody, the ass and titties\n\nDay to night to morning, keep with me in the moment\nI'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?\nDidn't even notice, no punches left to roll with\nYou got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so\nDay to night to morning, keep with me in the moment\nI'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?\nDidn't even notice, no punches left to roll with\nYou got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so",
