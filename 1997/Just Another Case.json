Sent her on a mission\nHope she ain't slip...on that pickup\nYo, who dis on my flip\nFuck the cash nigga, pistol whip ya ass\nMe and Mitch rollin' over there quick fast\nRolled up on the spot, (It's that kid Uzi Ed)\nHe took me for my paper so just call him Uzi Dead!\nUsed to run epps wit him back in the day\nMitch popped the trunk, passed the German AK\nYou dirty rat! I'm bout to bless the gat\nBetter take cover from the ratta-tat-tat\nUzi Ed, ain't have a vest\nThree to the chest, Ed got blessed\nL got life, Ed got death\nThe bitch took the money and she slid to the left\nBack in the day, I told L she was shady\nNow she in Cali about to have Ed's baby\n\nNow this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh\nJust another case about the wrong path\nWell, this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh\nIt's just another case about the wrong path\nWell, this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh\nIt's just another case about the wrong path\nWell, this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh\nIt's just another case about the wrong path\nWell, this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh\nIt's just another case about the wrong path\n(Slick Rick)\nYo, what's the word, kid?!\nTell you bout a brother named Sid\nGot work release after doing a 3-to-life bid\nCause of drug logic\nShouldn't touch it\nNow out to budget\nWith a movie star chick from outta Edenwald Projects\nNice job, took prison camp drives\nWhile he promised up and down to live a civilized lifestyle\nThe sweat off the brow was soon on garment\nBoth worked\nGot themselves a two-bedroom apartment\nGreat statement, without delayment, away and went\nSaved to get a house on one of them low down payments\nBut an idea concocted his stock\nWhy don't we try and turn this money over on the drug tip\nSo he gave his man a shriek and excitement\nDidn't know his peeps were under secret indictment\nSick of the path that'll get you hung by the neck\nSent him back up north to do a super long stretch again\nBlack folk, you know the half, don't laugh, it's...\nJust another case about the wrong path\n\nWell, this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh\nIt's just another case about the wrong path\nWell, this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh\nIt's just another case about the wrong path\nWell, this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh\nIt's just another case about the wrong path\nWell, this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh\nIt's just another case about the wrong path",
