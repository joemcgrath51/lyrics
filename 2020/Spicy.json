Not I\nKnow my name, say my name\nYellow diamonds on my chain, lemonade\nI can never be your main, but tell your man\nYou gon' have to call him back another time\nGirl, let's get high and vibe\nGo up, get loud\nGet right here and now\nYeah, tell me\n\nWho tryna, who tryna go?\nWho gon' drop it down like there's money on the floor?\nWho tryna, who tryna bust it for the dollars?\nWho tryna freak, bring their homegirl and run it?\nShe my spicy lil' mama, she let me bust her pi\u00f1ata\nI buy her all the designer, but she's still leavin' tomorrow, ayy\n\nShe tryna pull my pants down\nI was lightin' up a \nstoge\n on my break time\nTold her, \"Babe, I got a meetin' over FaceTime\"\nShe don't care, my lil' mama never waste time (Ooh, wow)\nGotta catch a flight real quick\nSnuck a \nXanny\n on the plane in her fuckin' lipstick\nShe look at me and laugh, give a fuck what I think\nAnd she batshit crazy, but I like her like this, yeah\nShawty so bad, man, shawty so cold\nWanna go out, twenty-five years old\nMet her in the club, they were playin' \"Psycho\"\nNow we match APs and they all rose-gold\nAnd we both can agree\nOoh, she wilder than me\n\nYeah, tell me who tryna, who tryna go?\nWho gon' drop it down like there's money on the floor?\nWho tryna, who tryna bust it for the dollars?\nWho tryna freak, bring their homegirl and run it?\nShe my spicy lil' mama, she let me bust her pi\u00f1ata\nI buy her all the designer, but she's still leavin' tomorrow, ayy",
