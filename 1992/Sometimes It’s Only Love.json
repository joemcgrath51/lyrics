 "lyrics": "I am still your friend\nStanding by to catch you\nIf ever life should let you down\nAnd you should fall\nYou don't need to pretend\nIf ever doubt should find you\nI don't need to remind you\nI'm there for you before and after all\nI am who I am\nAnd I would never fool you\nI feel the same way you do\nAbout honesty\nBut do we understand\nHow love is sometimes jaded?\nIt keeps us separated\nEven though we'll never part\n\nSo to be lovers\nWe've got to understand\nToday is how today begins\nTomorrow's how it ends\nAnd to be lovers\nSome things we rise above\n'Cause sometimes love is wonderful\nBut sometimes it's only love\n\nLoving who I am\nIs something that you've taught me\nThe kind of love you've brought me\nTakes me through the day\nAnd even though our minds\nAre sometimes disagreeing\nOur hearts they're still believing\nWe'll work it out and stay\n\nSo to be lovers\nWe've got to understand\nToday is how today begins\nTomorrow's how it ends\nAnd to be lovers\nSome things we rise above\n'Cause sometimes love is wonderful\nBut sometimes it's only love\n\nKnew that one day it would be only love\nIt would be only...sometimes it's only love\nIt would be only love, ooh\nI knew that in time it would be only love\nIt would be only love\n\nAnd to be lovers\nWe've got to understand\nToday is how today begins\nTomorrow's how it ends\nAnd to be lovers\nSome things we rise above\n'Cause sometimes love is wonderful\nBut sometimes it's only love\n\nI knew that one day it would be only love\nIt would be only...sometimes it's only love\nIt would be only love, ooh\nSometimes love is wonderful\nBut sometimes it's only love",
