 "lyrics": "So sad to see you go so soon\nI know that you ain't comin' back\nIn the beginnin' everything was cool\nToward the end of it all, it's all bad\nI know I played my part in making it what it is\nAnd I know that you did the same\nI guess I'm up outta here\nI'm movin' on again, I sure that you will understand\nI played by the rules, You played by the game\nI couldn't have stayed, It's easier to say\nCause I was by your side when you went through the pain\nI guess it doesn't matter now that you're so far away\n\nAnd every minute you're gone, I missin' you so\nI can't believe that you're far away\nCan't get you out of my mind\nBoy you're out of my life\nI can't believe that you're far away\nAnd it would be different, if you could here me baby\nNow that you're so far away -ay -ay -ay\n\nTear stains on my pillow\nTryin' to forget ya\nDon't know what I'm gonna do\nFour day and countin', I've been layin' here\nStarin' myself in the mirror all alone in my room\nI can't feel this way again\nGotta think with my head\nCause my heart is what go me here\nSo hurt from what you done\nMore than enough reasons for me to move on\nCause I gave you my word, you put you're trust in me\nSupposed to be the one\nTo give you what you need\nI was by your side when we were meant to be\nGuess it doesn't matter now that you're so\n\n\nIf I had known Sunday morning, that you would be gone\nI would've never come home\nI wouldn't have answered my phone to hear the voice had a tone\nI knew that something was wrong\nThe cop's the one who had told me that you were alone inside an empty room\nIdentified you as my baby\nOh my baby, so far away\n\n\nPlease come back I miss you baby\n?\nWill you ever need me\nWithout you I can't go on\nX2",
