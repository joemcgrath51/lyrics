 "lyrics": "You ask me why\nI say why not\nAnything is possible\nAnything can be\nTherefore tonight\nI'll get you hot\nYou'll feel a passion you never dreamed\nAnd I know you feel\nI'm overconfident\nWhat kind of man could I be?\nIt's clear to see\nIt's like animal attraction\nWhen you add it up\nIt's just a matter of factions, girl\n\nSomething in your eyes told me\nThat you were looking for a man you could adore\nSomething in your eye\nHad given me a sign\nAnd I knew it was on\nI knew it was on\n\nYou think you're dry\nI say you're wet\nI can make it possible\nI can make it true\nAnd all night long\nI'll make you sweat\nGonna do a feeling\nThat's long past overdue\nAnd I know you think\nWhy so much confidence\nWhat kind of man must I be?\nIt's clear to see\nIt's like adding and subtracting\nWhen you add it up\nIt's just animal attraction\n\n\nSo when I get inside\nAnd make you wet\nI'll lick you dry\nCreate your body weak\nFrom all the body heat\nAnd like a lion\nYou'll hear me roar\nAnd when I feed it to your body\nMake that body\nGet weak some more\nI'll take you to the peak\nI'll make you wanna scream\nAnd like a lion\nYou'll hear my body\nRoar and roar\nAnd roar and roar and roar\n\n\nAnything is possible\nAnd anything can be\nYou can feel a passion you never dreamed of\nSee it in your eyes\nYou've given me a sign\nAnd I knew it was on\nI knew it was on\nIt was something in your eyes\nThat took me to feel it\nSomething in your eyes\nAnd hey, I can see it\nSomething in your eyes\nHad given me a sign\nAnd I knew it was on\nI knew it was on",
