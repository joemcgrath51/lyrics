 "lyrics": "I'm not going nowhere\nI'm staying; baby, I'm staying\nYou know why?\nI've got staying power\n\nBaby, I've made plans\nIn a fancy restaurant where we can dance\nPut on my favorite dress\nYou know the one that oozes sexiness\nTonight, when we make love\nI'm going to work your body with my tongue\nOh baby, my mission's clear\nThere's more than love that keeps you here\n\nI've got staying power\nJust when you think it's over\nI'll come right back again\nI've got staying power\nJust when you think it's over\nI'll come right back again\nI've got staying power\nJust when you think it's over\n\nSlow down, don't be so fast\nAnticipation makes a good thing last\nTease me with your emotions\nSoon we'll share nature's body lotion\nAre you ready to free?\nGirl, you know you got just what I need\nOh baby, my missions clear\nIt's more than love that keeps you here\n\nI've got staying power\nJust when you think it's over\nI'll come right back again\nI've got staying power\nJust when you think it's over\nI'll come right back again\nI've got staying power\nJust when you think it's over\nI'll come right back again\n\nNo, baby, I'm not going anywhere\nNo no no, I'm not going anywhere\nI'll be here\nI'll be here\nFor years and years\n\nTonight when we make love\nI'm going to work your body with my touch\nOh baby, my mission's clear\nIt's more than love that keeps you here\n\nI've got staying power\nJust when you think it's over\nI'll come right back again\nI've got staying power\nJust when you think it's over\nI'll come right back again\nI've got staying power\nJust when you think it's over\nI'm right back again\nI've got staying power\nJust when you think it's over\nI'll come right back again",
