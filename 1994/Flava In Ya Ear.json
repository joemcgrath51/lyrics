This man's undisputed\nIn deep-rooted funk smoke that leaves your brains booted\nThis bad MC with stamina like Bruce Jenner\nThe winner, tasting MC's for dinner\nYou're crazy like that glue,\n to think that you could outdo my one-two that's sick like the flu\nBoy, I flip, boy, all the time\n\u2018Cause, boy, the rhyme you kickin' ain't worth a dime\nSeems like there's no competition in this rap world expedition\nYou come around, I'll knock you out position\nNo flav could ever dig a grave, for the Mack\nThe power pack in black, making cement crack\nAnd here comes the brand new flava in ya ear\nMack's the brand new flava in ya ear\n\nHere comes the brand new flava in ya ear\nTime for new flava in ya ear\nI'm kickin' new flava in ya ear\nMack's the brand new flava in ya ear\nHere comes the brand new flava in ya ear\nTime for new flava in ya ear\nI'm kickin' new flava in ya ear\nMack's the brand new flava in ya ear\n\nHa! The Mack's dope with more hope than your Pope\nBut for MC's more knots than rope\nI'd like to break it down, down-breaking forsaken\nLords of MC's shakin' with this track that my man's makin'\nMC's will run like a bomb threat\nI bet, or better yet, make you sweat\nGetting hotter than the sun get\nCraig Mack is the flav that rocks from here to Tibet\nI break all rules with my action\nThat the Mack sends to MC's, stop relaxin'\nThis brand new Sherrif that's in town\nGetting down, leaving bodies buried in the ground\nI set up rhymes for a decoy\nNow I'm a Bad Boy, watch the MC's I destroy, and\u2026\n\nHere comes the brand new flava in ya ear\nTime for new flava in ya ear\nI'm kickin' new flava in ya ear\nMack's the brand new flava in ya ear\nHere comes the brand new flava in ya ear\nTime for new flava in ya ear\nI'm kickin' new flava in ya ear\nMack's the brand new flava in ya ear",
