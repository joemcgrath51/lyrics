(Yeah!)\nThis is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)\nThis is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)\nThis is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)\nI'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)\nThis is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)\nI'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)\nThis is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)\n\nThis is why I'm hot: I don't gotta rap\nI could sell a mill sayin' nothin' on the track\nI represent New York, I got it on my back\nNiggas say that we lost it so I'ma bring it back\nI love the Dirty Dirty 'cause niggas show me love\nThe ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club\nBut in the Midwest, they love to take it slow\nSo when I hit the H, I watch 'em get it on the flo'\nAnd if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay\n'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it erryday\nCompton to Hollywood, soon as I hit L.A\nI'm in the low-low, I do it the Cali way (woo!)\nAnd when I hit the Chi, people say that I'm fly\nThey love the way I dress, they like my attire\nThey love how I move crowds from side-to-side\nThey ask me how I do it and simply I reply\n\nThis is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)\nThis is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)\nThis is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)\nThis is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)\nI'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)\nThis is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)\nI'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)\nThis is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)\n\nThis is why I'm hot, catch me on the block\nEvery other day, another bitch, another drop\nSixteen bars,\n \ntwenty-four a pop\nForty-four a song, nigga, gimme what you got\nI'm into drivin' cars, fresh up off the lot\nI'm into shuttin' stores down just so I could shop\nIf you need a bird, I could get it chopped\nTell me whachu need, you know I get 'em by the flock\nI call my homie Black, meet me on the Ave\nI hit Wash Heights wit' the money in the bag\nWe into big spendin', see, my pimpin' never drag\nFind me with different women that you niggas never had\nFor those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream\nPlayer, you come between, you better focus on the beam\nI keep it so mean, the way you seen me lean\nAnd when I say I'm hot, my nigga, this is what I mean\n\nThis is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)\nThis is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)\nThis is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)\nThis is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)\nI'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)\nThis is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)\nI'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)\nThis is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)\n\nThis is why I'm hot, shorty see the drop\nAsked me what I paid and I say \"Yeah, I paid a guap\"\nAnd then I hit the switch that take away the top\nSo chicks around the way, they call me Cream of the Crop\nThey hop in the car, I tell 'em \"All aboard\"\nWe hit the studio, they say they like how I record\nI gave 'em Black Train and I Did You Wrong\nSo every time I see them, man, they tell me that's they song\nThey say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm\nHangin' from the neck and compliments the arm\nWhich compliments the ear, then comes the gear (Woo!)\nSo when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare (Ha!)\nNiggas start to hate, rearrange they face\nBut, little do they know, I keep them things by waist side\nI reply \"Nobody got to die\"\nSimilar to Lil Weez 'cause I got the fire\n\nThis is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)\nThis is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)\nThis is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)\nThis is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)\nI'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)\nThis is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)\nI'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)\nThis is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)",
