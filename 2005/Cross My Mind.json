 "lyrics": "I was just thinking about you\nWondering if you wear the same cologne\nSmelled good on you\nHad the next boyfriend of mine try the same kind\nBut it stunk on him though\nYou know what they say, everything ain't for everybody\nBut I tried it anyway\nYou sure did smell good\nEh yeah\n\nYou just running cross my mind\nYou just running cross my mind\nYou just running cross my mind\nYou just running cross my mind\n\nYou had that masculine thing down\nShoulders, back straight\nNever sloping, never round\nIt would turn me on just to see you walk into a room\nAcross the room, out of the room\nYou really impressed me\nEh yeah\n\nYou just running cross my mind\nYou just running cross my mind\nYou just running cross my mind\nYou just running cross my mind\n\nI know if I pick up this phone, write this letter send this two way\nI know I'm gonna say some things, I know you gonna say some things\nThat we both don't mean to say\nLike, how amazing, how amazing\nWhen you would spread my limbs cross continents\nBump our bed way over mountains\nKiss this and this and this and this\nAnd this and this and this and this\nAnd this and this and this and that\nShow each other where the climax is at\n\nYou just running across my mind\nAcross my mind\nYou just running across my mind\nYou just running across my mind\n\nI was just thinking about you\nWondering what you doing I mean what you've been up to\nI know it's wrong feeling so strong\nLet me take a second minute I will think this thing through\nI was just thinking about you\nWondering what you doing I mean what you've been up to\nI know it's wrong feeling so strong\nLet me take a second minute I will think this thing through\n\nRemember all the moments for two?\nHow we used to\nOh yeah\nBut the reality honestly\nYou were never good for me and I was never good for you\nI just remember what we used to do",
