Let's go!\n\n25% of all men are unstable\n25% of all men can't be faithful\n30% of them don't mean what they say\nAnd 10% of the remaining 20 is gay\nThat leaves you a 10% chance of ever finding your mate\nThat means you better pay attention to these words that I say\nI'm gonna teach you how expose the 90%\nAnd show you what to do to keep the other 10\n\nRule Number One: Don't be a booty call\nIf he don't respect you girl he gon forget you girl\nRule Two:\nIf he's in a relationship\nIf he will cheat on her that means he will cheat on you\nRule Three:\nTell him that you're celibate\nAnd if he wants some of your goodies he gon have to work for it\nRule Four:\nBe the person you wanna find\nDon't be a nickel out here lookin' for a dime\nStatistics\n\n15% of all men got a complex\n15% of all men don't practice safe sex\n20% of them come from homes without a father\nAnd there's a 50/50 chance that you'll marry a coward\nSomething to think about when you're taking a shower\nSomething to swallow when you're drinking bottled water\nI'm gonna teach you how to expose the 90%\nAnd show you what to do to keep the other 10\n\nRule Number One: Don't be a booty call\nIf he don't respect you girl he gon forget you girl\nRule Two:\nIf he's in a relationship\nIf he will cheat on her that means he will cheat on you\nRule Three:\nTell him that you're celibate\nAnd if he wants some of your goodies he gon have to work for it\nRule Four:\nBe the person you wanna find\nDon't be a nickel out here lookin' for a dime\nStatistics\n\nBe patient! He's waiting!\nYou don't gotta settle for that\nLeave what is past alone!\nGet you a backbone!\nStop being (sorry for) yourself!\nHave you no checklist?\nIt's gonna take patience\nTime is still wastin\n\nDon't be a booty call\nIf he don't respect you girl he gon forget you girl\nRule Two:\nIf he's in a relationship\nIf he will cheat on her that means he will cheat on you\nRule Three:\nTell him that you're celibate\nAnd if he wants some of your goodies he gon have to work for it\nRule Four:\nBe the person you wanna find\nDon't be a nickel out here lookin' for a dime\nStatistics",
