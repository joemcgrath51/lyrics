(All I need, all I need, is just one wish)\nUse to watch the sunrise\n(One wish, one wish)\nUse to watch the sunset (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)\nWe was everything to each other, you know? (Just one chance)\n(All I need, all I need, is just one wish)\nDamn, I miss those days\n(One wish, one wish, one wish)\n(All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)\nIf I could, if I could just hold you in my arms, you know what I mean? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish, one wish)\nIt just feels so good\n(One wish)\nOne little, itty, bitty wish\nIf I could just have one wish\nDamn baby..\nJust don't understand where we went wrong\nI gave you my heart\nI gave you my soul\nI gave you...\n\nAs a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first\nIt was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know\nWe were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room\nCause, we couldn't be alone\nSee your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt\nBack then we were in school and that's your favorite excuse\nGrowin' up I was a fool and I can't lie I'm missing you\nListen and don't trip\nI think I need a bottle with a genie in it\nHere's my wish list\n\nFirst one, I would create a heart changing love\nSecond one, I'll take yours and fill it all up\nThird one, but I don't need a lot of wishes\n'Cause I'll be okay if I get one\nIf I had one wish, we would be best friends\nLove would never end, it would just begin\nIf I had one wish, you would be my boo\nPromise to love you, trust me I'll trust you\nIf I had one wish, we would run away\nMaking love all day, have us a baby\nIf I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life\nAnd you'll be my wife, make it right this time\nIf I had one wish\nOne wish, one wish, one wish\nOne wish, one wish, one wish\nOne wish, one wish, one wish\nOne wish, one wish, one wish\n\nNow tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in\nIf so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho\nThen you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me\nSo girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe\nI swear if I lose a second chance with you\nI wouldn't know what to do\nI'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic\nI couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick\nHere's my wish list\n\nFirst one, I would create a heart changing love\nSecond one, I'll take yours and fill it all up\nThird one, but I don't need a lot of wishes\n'Cause I'll be okay if I get one\nIf I had one wish, we would be best friends\nLove would never end, it would just begin\nIf I had one wish, you would be my boo\nPromise to love you, trust me I'll trust you\nIf I had one wish, we would run away\nMaking love all day, have us a baby\nIf I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life\nAnd you'll be my wife, make it right this time\nIf I had one wish\n\nI don't even know how we ended upon this road\nAnd, even though we are grown, Girl I just want you to know\n\nIf I had one wish, we would be best friends\nLove would never end, it would just begin\nIf I had one wish, you would be my boo\nPromise to love you, trust me I'll trust you\nIf I had one wish, we would run away\nMaking love all day, have us a baby\nIf I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life\nAnd you'll be my wife, make it right this time",
