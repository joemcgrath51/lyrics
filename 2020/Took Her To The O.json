'Cause this gon' make the news\nGotta make your move, told that bitch, \"Get in,\" 'cause she lookin' confused\nI broke the rules, 'cause this bitch a witness, plus I just popped dude\nBut she ain't cryin', plus this ho was smilin' and this bitch looked cute\nSo we slide out, I'm checkin' my mirrors, made it to the house\nTold her hop out, she say that she hungry, I nod back, \"No doubt\"\n\"I know you mad 'cause I smoked your man, left him on the curb\"\nShe started laughin', she say, \"Fuck that nigga, he from 63rd\"\n\nJust got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee\nJust bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me\nThis bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go\nShe wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O\nJust got some top from this stripper bitch, she from Kankakee\nJust bought a Glock with a ruler clip, boy, don't play with me\nThis bitch a ho, met her at the store, you know how it go\nShe wanna smoke, so I bought some dope and took her to the O\n\nAnd took her to the O\nHuh?
