 "lyrics": "Trust in me\nYou thought it would be easy\nSomething like a shopping spree\nBut living life 'n limbo\nCreated your catastrophe\nNow you say you're sorry\nAnd that's good, but it's not over yet\nBut if you want me to forgive you\nI'll be willing to forget it ever happened\nErase it from my mind\nI gave my life to save you\nThat's the plan\nThat I designed, because\nI L-O-V-E U\nI L-O-V-EU\nPut your trust in me\n'Cause I L-O-V-E Y-O-U\nLately you've been thinkin'\nThat you're the captain of the sea\nBut when your ship was sinkin'\nYour transportation back was me\nDo you remember?\nNow you have concluded\nThat you need someone to navigate\nWhich leads me to the question\n\"When can we affiliate?\"\nI know survival\nIs not an easy task\nI've always been the answer\nBut I thought you'd never ask, you see\nI L-O-V-E U\nI L-O-V-E U\nPut your trust in me\n'Cause I L-O-V-E Y-O-U\nI L-O-V-E U\nI L-O-V-E U\nPut your trust in me\n'Cause I L O V E Y O U\nI'm more than able\nLike a beacon in the night\nTo see that you don't\nEver lose your way\nBecause your defense is defective\nEven at its best\nBut my efforts will never\nFail because\nG, H, I\n(J, K)\nL-O-V-E U\nI L-O-V-E U\nPut your trust in me\n'Cause I L O V E Y O U\nI L O V E U\nI L O V E U\nPut your trust in Me\n'Cause I L-O-V-E Y-O-U\nLove is patient\nLove is kind\nLove is no envy\nLove is not pride\nLove behaves\nLove is not selfish\nOr easily provoked\nLove is not evil\nLove shares truth\nInstead of spreading lies\nLove bears all\nLove believes all\nLove endures all\nLove is home for all\nLove never fails\nI L-O-V-E U\nPut your trust in me\n'Cause I love you\nPut your trust in me\n'Cause I love you\nPut your trust in me\n'Cause I love you\nPut your trust in me\n'Cause I love you\nPut your trust in me\n'Cause I love you\nPut your trust in me\n'Cause I love you",
