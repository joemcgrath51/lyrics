 "lyrics": "It's sad that memories never die\nJust fill your head with why\nThen you're caught living a lie again\nIt's sad that all he ever said\nWas that he loved me to death\nBut then he's gone again\nAnd I was wrong again\n\n'Cause you think it's easier\nEasy like that\nJust when I wasn't finished\nYou were gone like that\nCan't you hear me crying\n'Cause I need you back\n'Cause I'm slowly dying\n'Cause I need you bad\nBut you're gone and never coming back\nGone and not coming back\nHe's never coming back\n\nShoulda known\nThe long kiss goodbye\nWould bring sadness in my life\nWearing this disguise again\nI wish that you would have said\nOr lied to me instead\nLike a bullet to my head\nLike a fool I pretend\nThat it's on again\nOn again\n\n'Cause you think it's easier\nEasy like that\nJust when I wasn't finished\nYou were gone like that\nCan't you hear me crying\n'Cause I need you back\nAnd I'm slowly dying\n'Cause I need you bad\nBut you're gone and never coming back\nGone and not coming back\nHe's never coming back\n\nWho ever said look on the brighter side\nHas never been on mine\nWho ever said that he'll get his\nNever felt like this\nAin't no use in crying\nWhen you're done like that\n'Cause baby, baby you took something\nThat I can't buy back\n\nAnd now you're gone and never coming back\nComing back\nOoh he's not coming back",
