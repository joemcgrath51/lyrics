 "lyrics": "Nothing can make you high\nOr put fire in your eyes\nOr give you a chance to fly\nWhen you need the wings\nWhen all that you've got is doubt\nAnd nothing can stop you from feeling down\n\nBut oh, I know, I know exactly how you feel\n\nBut can you believe now\nWhen you're on your knees now\nBegging and pleading now\nCan you believe\nWhen all that you've got is doubt\nAnd no one to pull you out\nWhen your heart is slowing down\nCan you believe?\n\nSee the person I love the most\nIs so far away tonight\nAnd no other medicine or promise is\nGonna heal me up right\nBut I got to believe\nThat her and me\nWill be together\nCause that's all I got\n\nAnd oh, I know, when you're down at the bottom\nCan you believe?\n\n\nCan you believe when all hope seems gone\nWhen your mother and father can't keep you safe from harm\nCan you forgive in your heart?\nCan you ask for forgiveness\nWhen nobody else believes?\nCan you believe?\nCan you believe in yourself?\n\n\nIf nobody's watching\nYou will never know",
