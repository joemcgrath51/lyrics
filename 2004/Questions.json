Lost interest? Is he cheating?\nOoh, ladies, help me out\nDo he love me? Lost interest? Is he cheating?\nSaid I'm tired of all these ups and downs\nDo he love me? Lost interest? Is he cheating?\nFellas, tell me what y'all think\nDo he love me? Lost interest? Is he cheating?\nHere's the reason why I ask these things...\n\nI was giving him the best of me\nBut my best stopped being good enough\nI'm telling you I would do anything\nTalk about a woman who loves tough\nAnd now he's coming home real real late\nI let him know it's starting to bother me\nHe never once even touched his plate\nAnd no response, he just went to sleep\n\nPlease tell me what do you think it could be\nHeadache, tired, or cheating on me\nI'm tired of this up and down mystery\nPlease answer questions from one two three\n\nDo he love me? Lost interest? Is he cheating?\nOoh, ladies, help me out, yeah\nDo he love me? Lost interest? Is he cheating?\nSaid I'm tired of all these ups and downs, yeah\nDo he love me? Lost interest? Is he cheating?\nFellas, tell me what y'all thinking, yeah\nDo he love me? Lost interest? Is he cheating?\nCan you see why I ask these things?\n\nUsed to take me shopping (all the time)\nUsed to go club hoppin' (all the time)\nWhere you were, I would be (all the time)\nNow all you do is leave me (behind, boy)\nI used to be your best friend (remember)\nWe were close like cousins (remember)\nUsed to give me lovin' (and now)\nNow all you're doing is trippin'\n\nPlease tell me what do you think it could be\nHeadache, tired, or cheating on me\nSaid I'm tired of this up and down mystery\nPlease answer questions from one two three\n\nDo he love me? Lost interest? Is he cheating?\nTell me, fellas, do he love me?\nDo he love me? Lost interest? Is he cheating?\nCheating on me, I gotta know\nDo he love me? Lost interest? Is he cheating?\nLadies, you gotta ask yourself sometime\nDo he love me? Lost interest? Is he cheating?\nIs he cheating? Is he creepin'\nDo he love me? Lost interest? Is he cheating?\nI gotta know, said I gotta know\nDo he love me? Lost interest? Is he cheating?\nDo he love me?",
