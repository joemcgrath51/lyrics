 "lyrics": "I was young (BOP)\nAnd didn't have no where to run\nI needed to wake up (Wake up) and see (And see)\nWhat's in front of me (na-na-op)\nThere had to be a better way\nSing it again a better way\nTo show I'm grateful (hum)\nSo I thought up this song\nTo show my appreciation for lovin' me so long\nYou don't know much you mean to me\n\n'Cause even though when times got rough\nYou never turned away\nYou were right there\nAnd I thank you (thank you)\nWhen I felt I had enough\nYou never turned away\nYou were right there\nAnd I thank you (thank you)\n\nAll through my life\nI knew that you'd be my world\nKnowing everywhere I go\nThings you taught me they would show\nSo many times and changes\nYou've seen me through\nI sho nuff couldn't have survived without you, you\nAnd so I thought up this song\nTo show my appreciation for lovin' me so long\nYou don't know how much you mean to me, oh\n\n'Cause even though when times got rough\nYou never turned away\nYou were right there\nAnd I thank you (thank you)\nWhen I felt I had enough\nYou never turned away\nYou were right there\nAnd I thank you (thank you)\n'Cause even though when times got rough\nYou never turned away\nYou were right there\nAnd I thank you (thank you)\nWhen I felt I had enough\nYou never turned away\nYou were right there\nAnd I thank you (thank you)\n\n\n'Cause even though when times got rough\nYou never turned away\nYou were right there\nAnd I thank you (thank you)\nWhen I felt I had enough\nYou never turned away\nYou were right there\nAnd I thank you (thank you)",
