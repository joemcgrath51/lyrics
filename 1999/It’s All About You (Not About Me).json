 "lyrics": "When we first met\nStole my heart away\nYour love was incredible, wonderful\nThen you began to change\nYou used to make me feel special\nNow all you do is make me cry\nI gave you my everything, baby\nBut all you gave me was lies\n\nI, I\nTry to be the one\nFor baby\nYou\nNever was enough in\nWhat I do, do\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m leaving\n'Cause it\u2019s all about you\nAnd not about me\n\nWhen we get in a fight\nI\u2019m always the first to apologize\nEven if it was you who did wrong\nI never do enough to please you\nThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t go on\nNo matter what I do for you\nIt\u2019s never any good for you\nYou always got to complain\nThat\u2019s why I got to say\nI can\u2019t stay\n\nI, I try to be the one for baby\nYou, you never was into nothin'\nWhat I do, do\n\nSelfish baby\nAnything you want\nI do\nI never understand\nHow you could treat me bad\nAnd be so cruel\n\nYou\u2019re begging me to come back to you\nBaby, I gave you all my love\nBut what I had was not enough\nYou turned around\nBroke my trust\nGot the nerve to ask me\n\"What about us?\"",
