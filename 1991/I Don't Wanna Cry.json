 "lyrics": "Once again we sit in silence\nAfter all is said and done\nOnly emptiness inside us\nBaby, look what we've become\nWe can make a million promises\nBut we still won't change\nIt isn't right to stay together\nWhen you only bring each other pain\n\nI don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry\nNothing in the world could take us back\nTo where we used to be\nThough I've given you my heart and soul\n(\nGiven you my heart and soul\n)\nI must find a way of letting go\n'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry\nI don't wanna cry\n\nToo far apart to bridge the distance\nBut something keeps us hanging on and on\nPretending not to know the difference\nDenying what we had is gone\nEvery moment we're together\nIt's just breaking me down\nI know we swore it was forever\nBut it hurts too much to stay around\n\nI don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry\nNothing in the world could take us back\nTo where we used to be\nThough I've given you my heart and soul\n(\nGiven you my heart and soul\n)\nI must find a way of letting go\n'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry\nI don't wanna cry, no, no\n\nAll the magic's gone\nThere's just a shadow of a memory\nSomething just went wrong\nWe can't go on make-believing\nOn make-believing\n\n'Cause I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry\nNothing in the world could take us back\nTo where we used to be\nThough I've given you my heart and soul\n(\nGiven you my heart and soul\n)\nSaid I've given you my heart and soul\n(\nGiven you my heart and soul\n)\nI must find a way of letting go\n'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry, cry\nI don't wanna cry\nI don't wanna cry",
