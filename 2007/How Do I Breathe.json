 "lyrics": "How do I breathe?\nHow do I breathe?\nIt feels so different being here\nI was so used to being next to you\nLife for me is not the same\nThere's no one to turn to\nI don't know why I let it go too far\nStarting over - it's so hard\nSeems like everywhere I try to go\nI keep thinking of you\n\nI just had a wake up call\nWishing that I never let you fall\nBaby you are not to blame at all\nWhen I'm the one that pushed you away\nBaby if you knew I cared\nYou'd have never went nowhere (nowhere)\nGirl I should've been right there\n\nHow do I breathe\nWithout you here by my side?\nHow will I see\nWhen your love brought me to the light?\nWhere do I go\nWhen your heart's where I lay my head?\nWhen you're not with me\nHow do I breathe?\nHow do I breathe?\n\nGirl I'm losin' my mind\nYes I made a mistake\nI thought that you would be mine\nGuess the joke was on me\nI miss you so bad, I can't sleep\nI wish I knew where you could be\nAnother dude is replacing me\nGod this can't be happening\n\nI just had a wake up call (call)\nWishing that I never let you fall (fall)\nBaby you are not to blame at all\nWhen I'm the one that pushed you away\nBaby if you knew I cared (cared)\nYou'd have never went nowhere (nowhere)\nGirl I should've been right there\n\n(And I wonder...)\nHow do I breathe\nWithout you here by my side?\nHow will I see\nWhen your love brought me to the light?\nWhere do I go\nWhen your heart's where I lay my head?\nWhen you're not with me (I'm saying)\nHow do I breathe?\nHow do I breathe?\n\nI should've brought my love home, girl\nAnd baby I ain't perfect, you know\nThe grind has got a tight hold\nGirl come back to me\nCause girl you made it hard to breathe\nWhen you're not with me\n\n(Tell me)\nHow do I breathe\nWithout you here by my side?\nHow will I see\nWhen your love brought me to the light?\nWhere do I go (where do I, where do I go)\nWhen your heart's where I lay my head?\nWhen you're not with me\nHow do I breathe?\nHow do I breathe (How do I breathe)?\nWithout you here by my side?\nHow will I see (how will I see)\nWhen your love brought me to the light (baby, baby)?\nWhere do I go (where do)\nWhen your heart's where I lay my head?\nWhen you're not with me (you're not with me)\nHow do I breathe (How do I breathe)?\nHow do I breathe?",
