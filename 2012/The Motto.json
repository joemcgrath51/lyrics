That's really how you feel?\n'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill\nI mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will\nI can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?\n\nNow she want a photo, you already know, though\nYou only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO\nAnd we bout it every day, every day, every day\nLike we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play\nEvery day, every day, fuck what anybody say\nCan't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?\n\nOne...time? Fuck one time\nI'm calling niggas out like the umpire\nSeven...grams in the blunt\nAlmost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt\nIt's Eastside, we in this bitch\nWish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch\nAnd if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch\nThat's my MO, add a B to that shit\nI'm fucked up, tore down\nI'm twisted: doorknob\nTalk stupid? Off with your head!\nNigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed, yeah\nI'm so Young Money\nGot a drum on the gun, Energizer bunny\nFunny how honey ain't sweet like sugar\nAin't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers\nI tongue kiss her other tongue\nSkeet skeet skeet: water gun\nOh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi\n\nNow she want a photo, you already know, though\nYou only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO\nAnd we bout it every day, every day, every day\nLike we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play\nEvery day, every day, fuck what anybody say\nCan't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?\nNow she want a photo, you already know, though\nYou only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO\nAnd we bout it every day, every day, every day\nLike we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play\nEvery day, every day, fuck what anybody say\nCan't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?",
