(Let me know)\nI'm searching for my soul (Rockstar)\nWho ever turned you cold? (Because)\nYou need to let him know\nI can work miracles\nI'll work your physical (Physical)\nAnd when I love you close\nYou can feel my heart\nBeating through my clothes\nFuture\n\nI don't wanna give you the wrong impression\nI need love and affection\nAnd I hope I'm not sounding too desperate\nI need love and affection\nLove, love, love\nLove and affection\nLove, love\nL-o-v-e-e-e and affection",
