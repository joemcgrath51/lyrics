 "lyrics": "I can only blame myself\nTo think that someone else could ever take your place\nI must have been out of my head to turn away\nI said I needed time and space\nI thought the grass was greener on the other side\nYou never miss your water \u2018til your well runs dry\nChorus\nI wrote you letters, you sent them back\nI'm gonna keep on trying, in my heart I still believe\nI'll take my chances, \u2018cause I can wait\nI promise that's what I'll do\u2026'til you come back to me\nTried to convince myself\nThe love we shared was over and a thing of the past\nWe'd grown apart and lost the feeling that we once shared\nJust didn't realize\nHow much I hurt you when I chose to say goodbye\nI had it all but I just wasn't satisfied\nRepeat Chorus\nBridge\n\u2018Cause there's no one in this world\nWho's gonna love you like I do\nI'll keep on wishing \u2018til you come back\nI won't give up \u2018til you're right here with me\nRepeat Chorus",
