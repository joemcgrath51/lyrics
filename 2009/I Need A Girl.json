You my Bonnie\nSay that I, I found the one\nI ain't gonna rest 'til I know for sure, so\n\nBaby, please believe me when I tell you that, I need a girl, need a girl\nSo come on pretty lady won't you holla back? I need a girl, I'ma tell you what I need\nI need a girl that's gon' be my baby, so if you love me say \"I'm your baby\"\nSo fine I go \"That's my baby\", so if you need me say \"You're my baby\"\n\nI'm a good man, who ain't got a lot to ask, just looking for something I can build on\nI'm a young man, with a whole lotta cash, just looking for a lady I can spend on\nSo all the young ladies in every little city when I come to your town, let me know that you down\nSitting patient, steady waiting for the day when I can face it\n\nThe one that can love me for, who I am and so much more\nIs it you? You my Bonnie\nSay that I, I found the one\nI ain't gonna rest 'til I know for sure, so\n\nBaby, please believe me when I tell you that, I need a girl, need a girl\nSo come on pretty lady won't you holla back? I need a girl, I'ma tell you what I need\nI need a girl that's gon' be my baby, so if you love me say \"I'm your baby\"\nSo fine I go \"That's my baby\", so if you need me say \"You're my baby\"\n\nYou could, be my everything\nOh you mean so much to me and I don't even know your name\nBut I know that, that I'm your man and you are my girl\nAnd if I ever meet ya, I'ma give ya the world, oh\n\nBaby, please believe me when I tell you that, I need a girl, need a girl\nSo come on pretty lady won't you holla back? I need a girl, I'ma tell you what I need\nI need a girl that's gon' be my baby, so if you love me say \"I'm your baby\"\nSo fine I go \"That's my baby\", so if you need me say \"You're my baby\"\nBaby, please believe me when I tell you that, I need a girl, need a girl\nSo come on pretty lady won't you holla back?
