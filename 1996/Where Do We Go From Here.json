 "lyrics": "When you're in love\nSome things you take\nFor granted until someone\nPulls it apart\nAnd leaves you with half of your heart\nHow do I trade the best\nI have for less without giving up\nShould I slowly accept\nThat we'll be no more than just friends\nHow do I know\nWhen to let go?\nI know what I'm feeling inside\nBut part of me still wants to try\nSo tell me\n\nWhere do we go from here?\nWhy's my heart filled with so much fear?\nWhen all that you are is\nAll I need and more\n\nThere's no winning this\nThe battle's just begun\nI know it's over\nBut I still feel the same\nYou'll always remain number one\n'Cause letting go\nWarrants so much\nI know what I'm feeling inside\nBut part of me still wants to try\nSo tell me\n\n\nLetting go\nWarrants so much\nI know what\nI'm feeling inside\nBut part of me still wants to try",
