I'mma hit the shower\nEven though I'm about 2 hours... late\nBut I can't help it man\nIf they knew what I knew they would understand (understand)\nI'm washin' last night off, time to boss up\nThen suddenly on my back I feel a soft touch\nShe right behind me\nWater glistening off her body\nLookin' at me like one more time\nBut baby I gotta go I got responsibilities I gotta take care of (care of)\nThat's when you wrap them legs around me, and I fall victim to that lazy love (Woo!)\n\nYou got that I don't wanna, that \"I don't wanna go nowhere,\" you got that lazy love (hey)\nYou got that I don't wanna, that \"I don't wanna do nothing,\" you got that lazy love (Hey)\nYou got that I don't wanna, that \"I don't wanna do nothing,\" you got that lazy love (Hey)\nYou got that I don't wanna, that \"I don't wanna do nothing,\"\n\nSaid oooh\nOooh, that lazy love\nOooh, yeah",
