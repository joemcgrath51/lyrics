 "lyrics": "Sometimes it's soft as a misty rain\nThat gently touches my soul\nIt cools the fire that burns in me\nAnd I simply lose control\nSo just\n\nRain down (on) on me\nLet your love just fall like rain\nJust rain on me\nJust rain down (on) on me\nLet your love just shower me\nJust rain on me\n\nFull as a dam at capacity\nMy passion's about to explode, yeah\nI can't escape, it's surrounding me\nI'm caught in a storm\nThat I don't need no shelter from\n\nRain down (on) on me\nLet your love just fall like rain\nJust rain on me\nJust rain down (on) on me\nLet your love just shower me\nJust rain on me\n\nShower me\nSprinkle me\nFall down on me\n(Your love just falls on me)\nFall down, fall down on me\nLet it\nFall down, fall on me\nJust\nRain down on me\nChill me with your loving touch\nRain on me\nI wanna feel your love is real\nJust\nRain down on me\nMe\nRain on me\nOh baby\n\nRain down (on) on me\nLet your love just fall like rain\nJust rain on me\nJust rain down (on) on me\nLet your love just shower me\nJust rain on me\n\nSometimes it's soft as a misty rain",
