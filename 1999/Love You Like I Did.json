 "lyrics": "Tell me who's gonna look at you\nAnd love you for the person you are\nTell me who's gonna understand\nThat sometimes you can take things too far\nTell me who's gonna be there when\nTimes are good and when they are bad\nTell me who's gonna love you girl\nThe way I loved you\nTell me who's gonna be right there\nTo wipe your tears whenever you cry\nTell me who's gonna talk it out\nTo make sure everything is alright\nTell me who's gonna call you on the telephone\nWhen you're all alone\nTell me who's gonna love you girl\n\nAin't nobody gonna do the things I did\nAin't nobody gonna kiss the way I kiss\nAin't nobody gonna spend the way I spend\nAin't nobody gonna love you like I did\nAin't nobody gonna be the fool for you\nAin't nobody gonna open the doors for you\nAin't nobody going through what I went through\nAin't nobody gonna love you\nLove you like I did...\n\nAnytime you needed a friend\nGirl I was right there for you\nAnytime you needed love\nYou could call on me for that too\nThere is nothing, nothing that I wouldn't do for you\nTell me who's gonna love you girl\nThe way I loved you\nEverything you always wanted\nGirl you know I gave it to you\nNever had to worry cuz you knew\nI would take care of you\nAnd you may find, another man\nBut can't nobody love you\nThe way that I loved you\n\n\nHow could you do it?\nBaby, how could you (you did me wrong)\nTreat me the way you did (you broke my heart)\nAnd how could you leave me?\nWhen you know I did (leave me by myself)\nI did everything for you (girl, I did everything for you)\nAnd you'll never find another man to love you the way that I did\nGirl nobody... nobody...\nWill love you just like me...",
