 "lyrics": "Does it feel like ya\nYou're never gonna find it\nDoes it feel like ya\nAlways one step behind it\nDoes it feel like ya\nOut in this world alone\n'Cause you been looking\nAnd praying for love so long\nDoes it feel like ya\nWishing on a falling star\nDoes it feel like you\nLonely and it breaks your heart\n'Cause it feels like ya\nReady to let down your guard\nFinding somebody's just so hard\n\nHow do you find the one you dream about\n(How do you find it? Yeah)\nIf I knew I'd tell you how\n(Swear to God, swear to God)\nIt's kinda hard for me to figure out\n(And I know you're ready to settle down)\nI know you're ready to settle down\nIf there's a God above\nPlease tell me\n\nTell me\nWill I ever fall in love\nWill I be alone forever\nWill I ever fall in love\nOr will I be alone forever\n\nDoes it feel like ya\nMoving too fast\nDoes it feel like ya\nWant something you can't have\nDoes it feel like ya\nLiving in the past\nAnd the thought of going home alone\nAgain makes you sad\nDoes it feel like ya\nFeeling so bad\nDoes it feel like ya\nGetting so mad 'cause it feels like ya\nJust want someone to call\nTo tell ya that you're human after all\n\n\n\nTo fall in love\n(I would do anything, anything)\nTo fall in love\nTo fall in love, love, love, love\nTo fall in love\nTo fall in love",
