Baby\n(Heartaches you) Heartaches you've had\nYou gave your very best\nYou don't have to cry no more (No more)\nI'm what you're looking for (Mmm, hmm)\nNo more lonely nights\nWipe the tears from your eyes\nYou don't have to cry no more\nI'll never leave you lonely\nIf you give me the chance\nI'll wipe your tears away, put a smile upon your face\nI'll be there to kiss you in the moonlight\nBe the mornin' sun that greets you, be the whisper that says goodnight\n'Cause life's not over\nThis is just the beginning, yeah... Ooh, yeah\nPut your hands in my hand\nI'll show you love, baby, yes, I will, I'll never leave\n(Heartaches) Heartaches you've had\nYou gave your very best\nYou don't have to cry no more (No more)\nI'm what you're looking for (Trust me, baby)\nNo more lonely nights (Ooh, yeah)\nWipe the tears from your eyes\nYou don't have to cry no more (Shoo doo doo doo shoo doo)\nI'll never leave you lonely (Woo)\nI'll hold you in the middle of the night (Hey, baby)\nEverything is gonna be alright (Come close to D'Extra)\nCry no more ('Cause you don't have to cry no more)\nI'm what you're looking for (That's right 'cause I'll be there)\nI'm the one that you've been looking for (I'll hold you all night long)\nYou don't have to cry no more (Wipe all those tears away)\nCry no more (I'll be here for you, girl, I promise)\nI'll never leave you lonely (Forever)\nCry no more, no more, no more\nI'll treat you right, girl\nCry no more, no more, no more\nI'll make love to you all night long\nI wanna kiss you from your head right down\nCry no more, no more, no more\nRight down to your toes, woo\nCry no more, no more, no more\nI can treat you like you need to be treated, baby\nYeah... Yeah... Hey... Hey...",
