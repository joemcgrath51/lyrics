 "lyrics": "While he was schemin'\nI was beamin' in the Beamer just steamin'\nCan't believe that I caught my man cheatin'\nSo I found another way to make him pay for it all\nSo I went to Neiman Marcus on a shopping spree-ah\nAnd on my way, I grabbed Sole and Mia\nAnd as the cashbox rang, I thought everything away\n\n(Oops!) There goes the dreams we used to say\n(Oops!) There goes the time we spent away\n(Oops!) There goes the love I had\nBut you cheated on me and that's for that now\n(Oops!) There goes the house we've made a home\n(Oops!) There goes \"You'll never leave me alone\"\n(Oops!) For all the lies you told\nThis is what you're owed\n\nHey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild\nJust go back and hit 'em up style\nGet your hands on his cash and\nSpend it to the last dime for all the hard times\nOh, when you go, then everything goes\nFrom the crib to the ride and the clothes\nSo you better let 'em know that\nIf he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up\n\nWhile he was braggin'\nI was coming down the hill just draggin'\nAll his pictures and his clothes in a bag and\nSold everything else 'til there was just nothing left\nAnd I paid, all the bills about a month too late\nIt's a shame we have to play these games\nThe love we had just fade away, away\n\n(Oops!) There goes the dreams we used to say\n(Oops!) There goes the time we spent away\n(Oops!) There goes the love I had\nBut you cheated on me and that's for that now\n(Oops!) There goes the house we've made a home\n(Oops!) There goes \"you'll never leave me alone\"\n(Oops!) For all the lies you told\nThis is what you owe\n\nHey ladies (Hey ladies), when ya man wanna get buck wild\nJust go back and hit 'em up style\nGet your hands on his cash and\nSpend it to the last dime for all the hard times\nOh (Oh), when you go then everything goes\nFrom the crib to the ride and the clothes\nSo you better let 'em know that\nIf he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up\nHey ladies (Ladies), when ya man wanna get buck wild (Oh)\nJust go back and hit 'em up style\nGet your hands on his cash and\nSpend it to the last dime for all the hard times\nOh, when you go, then everything goes\nFrom the crib to the ride and the clothes\nSo you better let 'em know that\nIf you mess up, you gotta hit 'em up\n\nAll of the dreams you sold\nLeft me out in the cold\nWhat happened to the days when we used to trust each other?\nAnd all of the things I sold\nWill take you until you get old\nTo get 'em back without me\n'Cause revenge is just better than money, you'll see\n\nHey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild\nJust go back and hit 'em up style (Hit 'em up style)\nGet your hands on his cash and (Oh yeah)\nOh, when you go then everything goes\nFrom the crib to the ride and the clothes\nSo you better let 'em know that\nIf he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up (Oh-oh-oh)\nHey ladies (Hey ladies, hey ladies, hey ladies, yeah)\nWhoa, oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh no, oh no, yeah, oh oh oh\nIf he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up (Hit 'em up, yeah)\nHey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild (Buck wild)\nJust go back and hit 'em up style (Oh)\nGet your hands on his cash and (Da da dum, da da dum)\nOh, when you go then everything goes (Everything goes)\nFrom the crib to the ride and the clothes\nSo you better let 'em know that\nIf he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up",
