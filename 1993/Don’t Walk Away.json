We're not in right now\nBut if you leave your name and number\nWe'll get back to you, to you, to you\" *laughing*\n\nI got all this love, waiting just for you\nI just gotta know, that your love is true\nCan't keep running, boy, in and out my life\nWanna be your girl, not 'cause the mood is right\n\nIf I let you come inside, tomorrow will you hide\nWill you be there for me when I need someone to hold?\nBaby, don't misunderstand, I do want you for my man\nI just need a little time before I invest my love\n\nDon't walk away, boy (Ooh, don't walk away)\nMy love won't hurt you (No, no)\nDon't walk away, boy\nI'll be right there for you\n\nYou say all the things, that I like to hear\nYou push all my buttons, baby\nLove to have you close to me\nWanna feel your love, wanna be for sure\nThat it's me you need, baby, each and every night\n\nIf I let you come inside, tomorrow will you hide\nWill you be there for me when I need someone to hold?\nBaby, don't misunderstand, I do want you for my man\nI just need a little time before I invest my love\n\nDon't walk away, boy (Don't walk away, boy)\nMy love won't hurt you (No)\nDon't walk away, boy (Don't walk away)\nI'll be right there for you\n\nBaby, don't misunderstand\nI want you for my man\nI need a little time\nBefore I give you my love\n(Don't walk away, boy) Don't walk away\n(I'll be right there for you)\nDon't walk away\nThis is what it sounds like when we make love\n(Don't walk away, boy)\n(Don't walk away, boy)\n(I'll be right there for you)\nDon't walk away\n\nDon't walk away, boy (No)\nMy love won't hurt you (Won't hurt you)\nDon't walk away, boy\nI'll be right there for you (I'll be right there, oh yeah)\nDon't walk away, boy (Don't walk away)\nMy love won't hurt you (No)\nDon't walk away, boy\nI'll be right there for you",
