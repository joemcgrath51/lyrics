 "lyrics": "I know that when you look at me\nThere's so much that you just don't see\nBut if you would only take the time\nI know in my heart you'd find\nOh, a girl who's scared sometimes\nWho isn't always strong\nCan't you see the hurt in me?\nI feel so all alone\n\nI wanna run to you\nI wanna run to you\nWon't you hold me in your arms\nAnd keep me safe from harm?\nI wanna run to you\nBut if I come to you\nTell me, will you stay or will you run away?\n\nEach day, each day I play the role\nOf someone always in control\nBut at night, I come home and turn the key\nThere's nobody there, no one cares for me\nOh, what's the sense\nOf trying hard to find your dreams\nWithout someone to share it with?\nTell me, what does it mean?\n\nI wanna run to you\nI wanna run to you\nWon't you hold me in your arms\nAnd keep me safe from harm?\nI wanna run to you\nBut if I come to you\nTell me, will you stay or will you run away?\nRun away\n\nI need you here\nI need you here to wipe away my tears\nTo kiss away my fears, no\nIf you only knew\nHow much I wanna run...\n\n...to you\nI wanna run to you\nWon't you hold me in your arms\nAnd keep me safe from harm?\nI'll run to you\nBut if I come to you\nTell me, will you stay or will you run away?",
