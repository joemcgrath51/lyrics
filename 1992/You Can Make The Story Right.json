 "lyrics": "It's 5am when you walk in\nThis is where your story begins\nYou say you've been out with the fellas\nBut the perfume tells me where you've been\nWell I knew for sure, when you walked through the door\nYou had another lover\nI read the signs, but I tried to hide\nAll the pain I felt inside\n\nYou can make the story right\nI believe what you say though you tell me lies\nYou can make the story right\nIt's a fact to me, but it's fiction to you, oh...\n\nSame old song, same old story\nYou keep telling me lies\nYou think I don't mind that you're unfaithful\nBut you never see the tears I cry\nYou've been letting me down, but I can't give you up\nI don't wanna let you go\nWe've spent so much time, trying to make it right\nI don't wanna lose the love we have\n\n\nCan make the story right\nI believe what you tell me\nOh, oh...\n\nYou've been lettin' me down, but I can't give you up\nDon't want another lover\nWe've spent so much time trying to make it right\nI don't wanna lose the love we had",
