Can you say it?\nWhat's my name? Stop playin'\nWhat's my name? I need to hear it\nWhat's my name? Can you feel it?\nWhat's my name? So excited\nWhat's my name? That you like it\nWhat's my name? I need to hear you say it\nOh...\n\nSee, I know what you want\nGirl, you know I aim to please\nI could put in less work\nBut that's not my style, yeah, oh\nPushin' past real good, takin' you to ecstasy\nWhen it's all said and done, I wanna see you smile\nOh, how I long to see you smile\n\nI didn't know you were missin' me so much\nGirl, you knew what Would happen when we touched\nI'm not in a hurry, there's no rush\nI'm not tryna stop 'til you get enough\n\nWhat's my name? Can you say it?\nWhat's my name? We're not playin'\nWhat's my name? I need to hear it\nWhat's my name? Can you feel it?\nWhat's my name? So excited\nWhat's my name? That you like it\nWhat's my name? I need to hear you say it\nOh...\n\nBaby, all I want to do is put a smile upon your face\nMake it last so that it cannot be erased\nWhen you want this to stop, just let me know\nGonna take it nice and slow\nI'm gonna tell you that I'm also glad you came\nAnd I hope you feel the same\nEvery time you want\nYou know where to go\nWhat's my name?! Sugar\nWhat's my name?\nWhat's my name?\nWhat's my name?\n\nListen\nWhat's my name?\nYou're feelin' me and it's not just words\nWhat's my name?\nI'm whispering things in your ear that you never heard\nWhat's my name?\nOh yeah\nOh...What's my name?\nI got your back, girl, it feels so right\nWhat's my name?\nI missed you, girl, every day, every night\nWhat's my name?\nOooohhhh...\nWhat's my name?\nSay it, say it, say it\nWhat's my name?\nYeah, say it\nWhat's my name?\nYeah, say it\nWhat's my name?\nYes, yes, yes\nOh...What's my name?\nWhatever you want, whatever you need\nWhat's my name?\nYes, I'm there\nWhat's my name?\nOOOOOoooh...\nWhat's my name?\nOOOOOoooh yeah\nWhat's my name?\nOoh, just, stay right there for me, baby\nWhat's my name?\nNo, don't move a little bit, no\nWhat's my name?\nJust let me look at your pretty eyes just for a little while\nOh...What's my name?\nBaby, girl...\nWhat's my name?\nI just wanna, oh ooooohh\nWhat's my name?\nYes, but first...\nWhat's my name?\nFirst, I'm gonna, OHHHH..\nWhat's my name?\nYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nWhat's my name?\nAnd then I'm gonna WOOOOO...\nWhat's my name?\nWOOO...\nOh...",
