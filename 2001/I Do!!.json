 "lyrics": "He was a six foot stallion\nSaid a storybook thug\nHe was the kind\nThat made you wonder how he put down the love\nHe had a hickey in his pocket\nA phat rock in his ear\nHe made my heart stop pulpitating\nEvery time he came near\nHe has a spanking new Range for that tight wardrobe\nHis pants was saggin\nHe was plaided\nAnd his head was cornrows\nHe has his wrists bling-blinging\nAnd his long legs was bow\nHe tried to push up on me\nBut I knew he had me at go\n\nI do\nI wonder if you feel the same way I do\nI can see it in your eyes\nI entice you\nSo come on, shorty\nIf you think you can roll\nWith an iced out playa\nBalling out of control\n\nMe and my crew started grooving\nMade our way to the floor\nIt's time to activate my plan\nAnd give this hottie a show\nI shook my hips\nTook a dip\nRoll my tongue 'cross my lips\nAnd when he took his place to dance wit me\nI felt fingertips on the small of my back\nSo I had to react like I was playing hard to get\nAnd told that boy to step back\nBut when I looked deep in his eyes\nAll I could see was his soul\nI'm 'bout to make this guy my man\nThat I can tell you\nFa 'sho\n\n\nWatch me\nDrop, drop\nShake it\nFor the fellas who know\nWatch me pop\nPop my hips\nAs I dip and roll\nWatch me stop\nStop traffic as I walk through the room\nKnowing all the papi's want me\nBut all I want is you",
