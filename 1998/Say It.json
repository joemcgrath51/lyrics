 "lyrics": "Am I giving enough\nIs it all it should be\nWhen the water gets rough\nWill you still swim with me?\nSo afraid to come close\nI know that it may be too soon\nIt may be too much\nFor you to consume\n\nAnd I want to know if I can live inside your world\nAnd I want to know if I can give it to you girl\n\nYou know that I want to say it\nYou know that I need to say it\nYou know that I'd love to say it\nMy love just goes on and on and on\nYou know that I want to say it\nYou know that I need to say it\nYou know that I'd love to say it\nMy love just goes on and on and on\n\nI give you all that you need\nThere's no better place you could be\nAnd I know that in time\nYou will believe me\nSo please hold out your hand\nAnd let's exchange these golden bands\nCause I want you in my life\nI want you to be my wife\n\nAnd I want to know if I can live inside your world\nAnd I want to know if I can give it to you girl\n\nYou know that I want to say it\nYou know that I need to say it\nYou know that I'd love to say it\nMy love just goes on and on and on\nYou know that I want to say it\nYou know that I need to say it\nYou know that I'd love to say it\nMy love just goes on and on and on\n\nMy girl, is so special\nI want to give it all to you\nLoving you on and on\nMy girl, is so special\nI want to give it all to you\nLoving you on and on\n\nYou know that I want to say it\nYou know that I need to say it\nYou know that I'd love to say it\nMy love just goes on and on and on\nYou know that I want to say it\nYou know that I need to say it\nYou know that I'd love to say it\nMy love just goes on and on and on",
