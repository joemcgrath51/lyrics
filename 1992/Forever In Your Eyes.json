 "lyrics": "It came unannounced\nThis feeling I feel for you\nI had to know\nWas it love you felt too?\nNot through your words\nBut the way that you looked at me\nTold me just how\nHow much you really care\n\nSo don't you try\nAnd hide your feelings\nCause it's so very plain to see\nI can see forever\nForever in you eyes\nJust let your heart\nFaithfully guide you\nGuide you to love infinity\nI can see forever\nForever in your eyes\n\nHere we are\nBaby, the time is right\nNow there's no doubt\nWhat we feel is right\nSo just say the word\nCause I'm in it much too deep\nTo turn away\nSo please say you'll stay\n\n\nGirl, I wanna hold ya\nYour head on my shoulder\nWith you\nI'll never tire\nWe'll take it higher and higher\nGirl, I wanna hold ya\nYour head on my shoulder\nWith you\nI'll never tire\nWe'll take it higher and higher\nI'll never hurt you, baby\nI'll never be untrue\nAll my hopes and dreams\nAre realized in your bed, baby\nI'll never leave you, sugar\nI'll never leave your side\nOur love is here forever\nI can see it in your eyes",
