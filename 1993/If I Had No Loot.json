 "lyrics": "If the shoe fits\nI want you to wear it and wear it good\n\nTalking 'bout them times when I was by myself\nI would always be looking for somebody else\nBut, as time went on, I had a talk with my mind\nFriends like you and you I gotta leave behind\n\nAnd so, you call me your friend\nBut you only want my ends\nAnd I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)\nI'm just glad I know the truth\nAnd I'm paying my own bills\nAnd I'll never ever depend on you\n\nFriends and enemies around me every day\nI can't believe half the things they say\nTaking me for granted giving no credit at all\nI'll just keep bouncing like a bouncing ball\nEverybody seems to disappear on me\nCan't trust no one as far, as I can see\nIf I could be that fly that's on the wall\nListening to my friends talk about it all\n\nYou call me your friend\nBut you only want my ends\nAnd I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)\nI'm just glad I know the truth\nAnd I'm paying my own bills\nAnd I'll never ever depend on you\nSons of Soul, y'all\n\nI don't mean to step on nobody's foot, but ah -\n\nWhen I need somebody there's nobody to call\nWhen they need me, my phone rings off the wall\nBut these are my friends, and that's what they say\nConstantly taking from me every day\nYou say...\n\nYou call me your friend\nBut you only want my ends\nAnd I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)\nI'm just glad I know the truth\nAnd I'm paying my own bills\nAnd I'll never ever depend on you\nSons of Soul, y'all\n\n\nYou call me your friend\nBut you only want my ends\nAnd I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)\nI'm just glad I know the truth\nAnd I'm paying my own bills\nAnd I'll never ever depend on you",
