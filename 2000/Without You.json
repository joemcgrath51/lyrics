 "lyrics": "It feels like a lifetime\nA thousand days have passed by\nSince I held you close to me\nIf I could see that smile from my friend\nI know that I could live again\nI need you here with me\n\nHeaven knows what to say\nEven though for right\nNow you're so far away\nI hope and I pray\nSomewhere in your heart I'll always stay\n\nGirl, lately my sun doesn't shine without you\nNever noticed what it feels like to be without you\nFeels like I took my last step\nAnd my last breath in my life ending\nHad to say just what I was feeling girl\nCause my sun doesn't shine\nSun doesn't shine without you\n\nThis is more for me than for you\nGirl, I finally see there's no substitute\nFor what we have\nDo you know how much I love you\nAnd what we share I can't forget\nGirl a love like yours I'll never let just slip away\nJust promise that you'll stay\n\nHeaven knows what to say\nEven though for right now you're so far away\nGonna tell you and show you\nDo whatever I can do to get back to you\n\nGirl, lately my sun doesn't shine without you\nNever noticed what it feels like to be without you\nFeels like I took my last step\nAnd my last breath in my life ending\nHad to say just what I was feeling, girl\nCause my sun doesn't shine\nSun doesn't shine\n\nHave you ever seen a flower that never blooms?\nSeen a starless night without the moon\nWell that's me without you\nSo come back and turn my nights into days\n\nGirl, lately my sun doesn't shine without you\nNever noticed what it feels like to be without you\nFeels like I took my last step\nAnd my last breath in my life ending\nHad to say just what I was feeling, girl\nCause my sun doesn't shine\nSun doesn't shine without you",
