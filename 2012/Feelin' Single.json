 "lyrics": "\"I can't believe you're playin' me like this\nAfter all the love we shared\nThe good times we've had, remember, yeah\"\nFeels like it's over\nMy heart tells me she's in love with someone else\nGave me the cold shoulder\nBut it's her loss, cause I could find me somebody else\nIf she wanna hit the town and party all night with her friends\nIf she wanna fool around, woah\nThen two can play that game baby\n\nYou got me feelin' single, 'bout to get out\nFind somebody, who's gonna love me\nFeelin' single, night is young\nHit the club, and take somebody home with me\nGet it, get it, get it, get it\nWE can get it baby get it, get it\nNow that I'm single\nShe said forever\nTurned out to be the biggest lie of all time\nAnd she changed my weather, yeah\nRainin' all day, no chance of sunshine\nIf she wanna hit the town and party all night with her friends\nIf she wanna fool around, yeah\nThen two can play that game baby\n\nThe way I see it you're not gonna do right\nOh by me baby girl\nThen I might as well, then I might as well\nI might as well get out and mingle\nCause you got, you got, you got me feelin' single",
