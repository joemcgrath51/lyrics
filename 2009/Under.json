 "lyrics": "(Verse 1)\nCallin' my river to let her know\nI'mma be on my way\nMissin' how the river flow even though\nIt's only been a couple of days\nBecause it be raining ain't complaining but...\nYou got that water made for drinking up\nBaby if I drown tonight its all worth it for you\nI don't need no rescue\n(Chorus)\nI'mma hold my breath until you feel it in your chest\nWhen I go Under, Under\nI ain't coming up until you screaming \"I give up\"\nWhen I go Under, Under\nYou be making waves, my ships here to stay\nI got what it takes to swim up in all day\nI want you to shake it, later tell me it was great\nWhen I go under, under\n(Verse 2)\nGirl relax, captain can handle that\nI'm gonna take this cruise real slow\nHeading to paradise, close your eyes\nAll you gotta do is let it go\nThe way your body flow, it's a private show\nAnd I can't stop until it's spilling over\nIt's a sight to see you and it's calling me\nTelling me your body's getting closer\n(Chorus)\nI'm gonna hold my breath until you feel it in your chest\nWhen I go under, under\nI ain't coming up until you screaming I give up\nWhen I go under, under\nYou be making waves, my ship's here to stay\nI got what it takes to swim up in it all day\nI want you to shake it, later tell me it was great\nWhen I go under, under\n(Bridge)\nI'm jumping in, no lifesaver\nDon't know when I'm coming up\nDeep sea diving in your treasure\nI'm giving you all this pleasure\nOoh girl, I'm so into you\nSo deep I don't know what to do\nJust let the water flow\nTill the tidal wave washes us ashore\n(Chorus)\nUnder, under\nUnder, under",
