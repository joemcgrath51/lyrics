 "lyrics": "It was the summer 2001\nAll before the drama begun\nWhen we first met\nI seen you sitting out on your steps\nYou was broke down crying a mess\nSo I interferred\nI asked what's the reason for tears\nI was wishing you could tell me your fears\nBut I'll start with ya name\nYou told me how ya man playin games\nSo I said that it was time for a change\nAnd you just laughed\nBut it looked like you ain't laughed in while\nI was glad that I could give you a smile\nThen we both blushed\nBut really girl it ain't no rush\nI was thinking maybe we can discuss\nA future for us\nCause homeboy just got you crushed\nYou need to leave that clown in the dust\nTrust, I just wanna talk\nI'm thinking I can give you a call\nAnd we can pick it up\nWhere we left off\nI'll holla tomorrow\n\nGirl I understand you loyal to ya man\nAnd that's alright aww baby\nBut that don't change the fact\nThat you fine and you stay crying every night nah baby\nGirl you got to let him know\nYou can't live like this no more\nNah baby\nCan't ya see\nTogether you and me could be so special ah baby\n\nOur feelings get greater\nA million days later\nTalking all night we stay up but\nHere comes ya ex\nReturned with that drama and stress\nAll the nonsense that you just left but yet\nYou except and go back to try it again\nThen return with a broken heart\nThat I gotta mend\nThat's unfair\nI've only been your lover and friend\nAnd homey there he just front and pretend\nBut you don't care the life he leads is unsafe\nI would never place my hands to your face\nBut still I chase\nCat and mouse\nFirst you kick him out\nThen you at his house\nWhat is that about\nI can't figure you out\nEven your friend said I was better\nBut you listen to him\nNever like uh-uh whatever\nSo the next time hurt you again\nYou already knew where you should've been\nAnd that's with me\n\n\nAll the times\nYou 2way telling me\nThat you miss me\nWanting me to come over and keep you busy\nRemember that\nNow that you gone\nIt's been kinda hard\nCan't think, can't sleep\nCan't do nothing at all\nJust tell me why you had to go back\nSee you ain't have to go through that\nMy baby\nYou could've been here right by my side\nMe and you at the park taking walks outside\nBut instead, I keep on having these dreams\nWaiting for my phone to ring\nMy baby wishing that it would be you\nBut I know that won't come true",
