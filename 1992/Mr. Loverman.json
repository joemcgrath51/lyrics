 "lyrics": "I'm headed straight for the floor\nThe alcohol's served its tour\nAnd it's headed straight for my skin\nLeaving me daft and dim\n\nI've got this shake in my legs\nShaking the thoughts from my head\nBut who put these waves in the door?\nI crack and out\nI pour\n\nI'm Mr. Loverman\nAnd I miss my lover, man\nI'm Mr. Loverman\nOh, and I miss my lover\n\nThe ways in which you talk to me\nHave me wishing I were gone\nThe ways that you say my name\nHave me running on and on\nOh, I'm cramping up, I'm cramping up\nBut you're cracking up, you're cracking up\n\nI'm Mr. Loverman\nAnd I miss my lover, man\nI'm Mr. Loverman\nOh, and I miss my lover\n\nI've shattered now\nI'm spilling out\nUpon this linoleum ground\nI'm reeling in my brain again\nBefore it can get back to you\nOh, what am I supposed to do\nWithout you?\n\nI'm Mr. Loverman\nAnd I miss my lover, man\nI'm Mr. Loverman\nOh, and I miss my lover\nI'm Mr. Loverman\nAnd I miss my lover, man\nI'm Mr. Loverman\nAnd I miss my lover",
