Act more stupidly\nBought more jewelry,\n \nmore Louis V\nMy mama couldn't get through to me\nThe drama, people suing me\nI'm on TV talking like it's just you and me\nI'm just saying how I feel man\nI ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman\nI guess the money should've changed him\nI guess I should've forgot where I came from\n[Hook: Kanye (w/ \nYoung Jeezy\n)]\nLa, la, la la\nWait 'til I get my money right\nLa, la, la la\nThen you can't tell me nothing, right?\nExcuse me, was you saying something?\nUh-uh, you can't tell me nothing\nYou can't tell me nothing\nUh-uh, you can't tell me nothing\n\nLet up the suicide doors\nThis is my life, homie, you decide yours\nI know that Jesus died for us\nBut I couldn't tell ya who decide wars\nSo I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways\nOld folks talking 'bout, \"Back in my day\"\nBut homie, this is my day\nClass started 2 hours ago, oh, am I late?\nNo, I already graduated\nAnd you can live through anything if Magic made it\nThey say I talk with so much emphasis\nOoh, they so sensitive\nDon't ever fix your lips like collagen\nAnd say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing\nLet me know if it's a problem then, aight, man, holla, then\n[Hook: Kanye (w/ \nYoung Jeezy\n)]\nLa, la, la la\nWait 'til I get my money right\nLa, la, la la\nThen you can't tell me nothing, right?\nExcuse me, was you saying something?\nUh-uh, you can't tell me nothing\nYou can't tell me nothing\nUh-uh, you can't tell me nothing\n\nLet the champagne splash, let that man get cash\nLet that man get past\nHe don't even stop to get gas\nIf he can move through the rumors, he can drive off of fumes 'cause\nHow he move in a room full of no's?\nHow he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?\nMust be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul\nSo when he buried in a tomb full of gold\nTreasure, what's your pleasure?\nLife is a, UH, depending how you dress her\nSo if the Devil wear Prada\n, \nAdam Eve wear nada\nI'm in between but way more fresher\nWith way less effort, \n'cause when you try hard\nThat's when you die hard\nYour homies looking like why God\nWhen they reminisce over you, my God\n[Hook: Kanye (w/ \nYoung Jeezy\n)]\nLa, la, la la\nWait 'til I get my money right\nLa, la, la la\nThen you can't tell me nothing, right?\nExcuse me, was you saying something?\nUh-uh, you can't tell me nothing\nYou can't tell me nothing\nUh-uh, you can't tell me nothing\n\nLa, la, la la\nWait 'til I get my money right\nLa, la, la la\nThen you can't tell me nothing, right?\n(I'm serious, nigga, I got money)",
