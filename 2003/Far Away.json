 "lyrics": "I'm tired of broken street glass\nNot gettin' no ass unless the babies sleep\nBut even then it seems like we're tryin' to creep\nTired of payin' taxes, sendin' e-mails and faxes\nTired of crooked cops\nTired of black folk complaining that crime don't stop\nI wanna go to a place where lovers go\nDo the things that lovers do\nNo stress\nA sweet caress from me to you\nI wanna do the things we used to do\nSay the things we used to say\nJust like everyday, all day\n\nFar away from here\nFar away from here\nFar away from here\nJust jump in a taxi cab, pack a bag and get away fast\nFar away from here\nFar away from here\nFar away from here\nJust jump in a taxi cab, pack a bag and get away fast\n\nTired of late subway trains\nTired of undeserved fame\nTired of watchin' Somethin' on the T. V. Doin' nothin'\nDoin' nothin'\nI'd rather be lookin' at ya\nI'd rather be layin' with ya\nI don't wanna forget all the love we captured the day we met\nI wanna go to a place where lovers go\nDo the things that lovers do\nNo Stress\nA sweet caress from me to you\nI wanna do the things we used to do\nSay the things we used to say\nJust lay everyday, all day\n (3x)",
