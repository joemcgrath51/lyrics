How you doin'? \n(all right)\nWell, I've been hangin', sangin' tryna do my thang, oh, you heard that I was bangin'\nYour homegirl you went to school with? That's cool\nBut did she tell you about her sister and your cousin? Thought I wasn't \n(uhh)\nSee, weekends were made for \nMichelob\nBut it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo\nAnd don't mistake my statement for a clown\nWe can keep in the down low long as you know that I get around\n[Chorus: Shock G & \n2Pac\n]\n'Round and 'round, around we go\n2Pacalypse Now don't stop for hoes, I get around\n'Round and 'round\n'Round and 'round, around we go\nWhy I ain't call you? Hahahah, please!\n'Round and 'round\n\nFingertips on the hips as I dip\nGotta get a tight grip, don't slip; loose lips sink ships\nIt's a trip, I love the way she licks her lips, see me jockin'\nPut a little twist in her hips \u2018cause I'm watchin'\nConversations on the phone 'til the break of dawn\nNow we're all alone, why the lights on?\nTurn them off! Time to set it off, get you wet and soft\nSomethin' is on your mind, let it off\nYou don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me\nWell, if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweatin' me?\nIt's a lot of real Gs doin' time\nCause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie\nYou picked the wrong guy, baby, if you're too fly\nYou need to hit the door, search for a new guy\n'Cause I only got one night in town\nBreak out or be clowned, baby doll are you down?\nI get around\n\n'Round and 'round, around we go\n'Round and 'round, around we go, uhh\n'Round and 'round, around we go\n'Round and 'round, around we go\n'Round and 'round, 'round we go\n'Round and 'round, 'round we go\n'Round and 'round, 'round we go, whoa\n'Round and 'round we go\n'Round and 'round\n'Round and 'round\n'Round and 'round\n'Round and 'round",
