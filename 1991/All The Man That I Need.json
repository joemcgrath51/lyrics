 "lyrics": "I used to cry myself to sleep at night\nBut that was all before he came\nI thought love had to hurt to turn out right\nBut now he's here\nIt's not the same, it's not the same\n\nHe fills me up\nHe gives me love\nMore love than I've ever seen\nHe's all I've got\nHe's all I've got in this world\nBut he's all the man that I need\n\nAnd in the morning when I kiss his eyes\nHe takes me down and rocks me slow\nAnd in the evening\nWhen the moon is high\nHe holds me close and won't let go\nHe won't let go\n\nHe fills me up\nHe gives me love\nMore love than I've ever seen\nHe's all I've got\nHe's all I've got in this world\nBut he's all the man that I need\nHe fills me up\nHe gives me love\nMore love than I've ever seen\nHe's all I've got\nHe's all I've got in this world\nBut he's all the man that I need\nHe fills me up\nHe gives me love\nMore love than I've ever seen\nHe's all I've got\nHe's all I've got in this world\nBut he's all the man that I need",
