 "lyrics": "Misery\nSuch a fool\nTo let you walk away from me\nNow it seems there's just nobody there for me\nGirl, I'm in agony for you\nGone without a trace\nDamn\nI need your loving just to feel this space\nI'm in so much pain without you\nYou left me here alone\nWhy don't you come back home to me?\nOh, everybody help me sing it\n\nThis is the place where you belong\nRight here in my arms\nWithout you\nSomething is wrong\n\nWaiting for your call\nCan't help thinking\nThat this mess is all my fault\nAnd just to have you back\nI swear I'd risk it all\nMy every thought is of you\nGirl, I'm on my knees\nBegging for forgiveness and your sympathy\nBut most of all my love\nI need your company\nThe only thing I need is you\nI need you back, my friend\nSo I can live again\nCome back home\nEverybody help me sing\n\n\nYou belong in my arms (5x)",
