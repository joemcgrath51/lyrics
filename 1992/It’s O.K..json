 "lyrics": "Maybe we can talk it over\nAnd save our hopes and dreams\nThough the waves seem endless\nSomehow we'll cross this angry sea\nWith love all things, things are possible\nIf we just believe\n\nI need to know, yes, it's okay\nCan I hurdle this storm?\nYes, but only together\nWith love in our hearts, the only way\nSomehow, somehow\nThings will work out, just you wait and see\nOh, it will, believe it will\n\nSee, real life confrontations\nCaused our vows to break\nBut I learned the word forgiveness\nCan with time chase the pain away\nTrue love (True love) made our hearts\nMade our hearts inseparable\nIf we just believe\n\nI need to know, yes, it's okay\nCan I hurdle this storm?\nYes, but only together\nWith God in our hearts, the only way\nSomehow, somehow, things will work out\nJust you wait and see\nOh it will, believe it will\n\nBut right now it hurts so bad\nAnd feels so bad\nBut tomorrow waits with laughter\nIf we endure the tears then joy comes after\n\nI need to know, you need to know\nIt's gonna be okay\nIt's gonna be okay\nCan I hurdle this storm, only together\nWith love in our hearts, the only way\nAnd somehow, somehow\nSomehow, I can feel love again\nSomehow, oh yeah, things have worked 'cause you\nYou stayed with me\nI'm glad to know it's okay, it's okay",
