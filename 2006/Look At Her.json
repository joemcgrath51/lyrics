Fabo!\nWhat's happenin'\nUs Us Us\nWhat's happenin'\nLook At her\nLook At her\nWhat's happenin'\nLook AT her!\nShawty, come here give me them goodies\nGot my perifial's on and girl I see you lookin'\nThe way you make it roll, then you stop wit it\nDrop down and then you make them fingers pop with it\nBaby, do ya thang, get ya shine on\nJust like that chandelier that's hangin on my collarbone\nSomethin' bout the way you bend your knees and rock yo hips (oh)\nAnd get the bitin' on your bottom lip (oh)\nBend low and bend your back up (Girl you're doin' that dance)\nSlow down I'm tryna catch up (But you're movin' too fast)\nLast call you know I'm thinkin' (shawty do you got plans?)\nLemme show you how I livin' (cuz I'm sittin on rims)\nLook At Her!\nShe know she sexy with her heels on\nLook At Her!\nThe way she dancin' know she\nLook AT Her\nLook At Her\nLook At her!\nI'm bout to see if I can take her home\nHave her hummin' in my microphone\nPatrone",
