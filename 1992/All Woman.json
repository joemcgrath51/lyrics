 "lyrics": "He's home again from another day\nShe smiles at him as he walks through the door\nShe wonders if it will be okay\nIt's hard for her when he doesn't respond\nHe says babe you look a mess\nYou look dowdy in that dress\nIt's just not like it used to be\nThen she says...\nI may not be a lady\nBut I'm all woman\nFrom monday to sunday I work harder than you know\nI'm no classy lady\nBut I'm all woman\nAnd this woman needs a little love to make her strong\nYou're not the only one\nShe stands there and lets the tears flow\nTears that she's been holding back so long\nShe wonders where did all the loving go\nThe love they used to share when they were strong\nShe says yes I look a mess\nBut I don't love you any less\nI thought you always thought enough of me to always be impressed\nI may not be a lady\nBut I'm all woman\nFrom monday to sunday I work harder than you know\nI'm no classy lady\nBut I'm all woman\nAnd this woman needs a little love to make her strong\nYou're not the only one\nHe holds her and hangs his head in shame\nHe doesn't see her like he used to do\nHe's too wrapped up in working for his pay\nHe hasn't seen the pain he's put her through\nAttention that he paid\nJust vanished in the haze\nHe remembers how it used to be\nWhen he used to say\nYou'll always be a lady\n'Cos you're all woman\nFrom monday to sunday I love you much more than you know\nYou're a classy lady\n'Cos you're all woman\nThis woman needs a loving man to keep her warm\nYou're the only one\nYou're a classy lady\n'Cos you're all woman\nSo sweet the love that used to be\nSo sweet the love that used to be\nWe can be sweet again...",
