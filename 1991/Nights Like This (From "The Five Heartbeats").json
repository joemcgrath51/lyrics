 "lyrics": "(Verse 1):\nToo much to think about\nToo easy not to think about\nBut the pain make you bring it out\nMaybe this something i should drink about\nThinking if the game and the fame gon bring a lil change\nNow i'm just contemplating liquor\nBut you know it start get ya\nWhen ya mind start to flicker\nLike maybe this something i should really fuck think about\nA penny for my thoughts\nTurned to nickels for my lines\nAnd rapping all these lines\nStarted gettin me the dimes\nNow i'm feelin like man i'm exactly what the game need\nQuarters turned into my dollar for a dream\nBut then you spending checks when you really should be saving\nMan fuck a freestyle when you write it like Langston\nBut you got the five heartbeats\nThen the temptations\nAnd ya conscience start the whispers\nAnd you really can't take it\nI'm just sayin\n(Chorus):\nAnd i ain't even finish\nCuz i ain't even win yet\nBut i know that i'm bound to\n4th quarter and you down two\nAnd i ain't even finish\nCuz i ain't even win yet\nBut i know that i'm bound to\n4th quarter and you down two\n4th quarter and you down two\n4th quarter and you down two\nAnd i ain't even finish\nCuz i ain't even win yet\nBut i know that i'm bound to\n4th quarter and you down two\n(Verse 2):\nThen you try to flip a dollar\nJust to get something new\nNow you touchin bases\nTurnin one into two\nLike baseball\nOne day its gon pay off\nPlus you know 3's coming soon\nBut then you start to panic\nBut you can't get flustered\nCuz its a cold war\nSo you know they start rush ya\nBut you a rare kind and they'll never be another\nPlus its a cold world\nBe sure to bring a cover\nCuz the 4 in sight\nTurn to 5 by night\nMan a 6 would be fine\nBut you want 7-8-9\nBut then you hit 10\nThink you never win again\nThen you pray to god and you see its all meant\nSo you finally see that you can't be stopped\nTold you shoot for the moon so you aim for the top\nSo you finally see exactly why you got the rock\n4th quarter down 2 and then you take the shot\n(Chorus):\nAnd i ain't even finish\nCuz i ain't even win yet\nBut i know that i'm bound to\n4th quarter and you down two\nAnd i ain't even finish\nCuz i ain't even win yet\nBut i know that i'm bound to\n4th quarter and you down two\n4th quarter and you down two\n4th quarter and you down two\nAnd i ain't even finish\nCuz i ain't even win yet\nBut i know that i'm bound to\n4th quarter and you down two\nThaNuRelijun:\nDear God\nI think i found a new religion\nAnd its based on the true condition that was truly missing\nI was thinking of my brother who think they found you in prison\nAnd my other brothers that drown in the new prescription\nCuz they been praying every night\nBut they feel like you don't listen\nI became the smartest\nWhen i took my art sense\nMixed it with my darkness\nAnd became a true artist\nSo now i'm putting portraits\nOn vinyls or murals with a title\nThese illustrations i'm painting\nAre truer than the bible\nI mean no disrespct but this is the new religion\nLike expressionizm\nIf you close ya eyes and envision a television\nBut without a picture\nJust scriptures that come to life\nOr headless sculptures that walk around at night\nAll i need is one mic\nShit now i might need 3\nPromise before i die to get the revolution\nOn TV or maybe in 3D\nYou think that they'll see it then\nI mean just picture me rollin\nThe blackGOD lacing my rap ties\nAnd after i die just play this and close ya eyes\nIf you ever wanna see me again\nI mean im like Edgar Allan but with better styling\nThis my tell tale heart but with 11 volumes\nSculptures and portraits portrayed\nFrom photo albums stuck in my memory\nI just hope they remember me through infinity",
