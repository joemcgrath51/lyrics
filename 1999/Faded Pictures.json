 "lyrics": "That's right\nLife is funny ain't it\nSometimes you can end up with\nSomebody you really don't wanna be with\nAnd others left to figure it out\nCheck it\n\nShe was more than a women, a goddess for all it seems\nAll I ever needed was her right here loving me\nFor a while we were cool and the groovin' love was on\nBut I still remember how it felt when our love was gone\n\nIn a tattered picture book\nWas a photograph she took years ago\n(Secret memories in her mind)\nSecret memories in her mind\nHow could love be so unkind?\nHeartbreak time (my heart is breaking)\n\nFaded pictures in a broken glass (broken glass)\nLike a mirror revealing (I see... I see)\nWhat the woman is feeling\nWas it someone from a distant past? (way back long ago)\n'Cause it's breaking my heart\nTo watch her stare into the glass (Joe help me out!)\n\nAs she turned through the pages the tears rolled down her face\nI could see her reminiscing, why her life had to be this way\nThen she stopped and she came to a page where her diary ends\nTo smell the scent of an old rose, from her lover I suppose\n\nIn a tattered picture book (tattered picture book)\nWas a photograph she took (she took) years ago\n(Secret memories in her mind)\nSecret memories in her mind, (oh oh)\nHow could love be so unkind? (unkind)\nHeartbreak time\n\nFaded pictures in a broken glass (Oh baby)\nLike a mirror revealing (Like a mirror revealing)\nWhat the woman is feeling\n(was it someone from a distant past?)\nWas it someone from a distant past? (Oh oh)\n'Cause it's breaking my heart (it's breaking my heart)\nTo watch her stare into the glass (stare into the glass)\n\n(Oh na na na na)\nJust keep spinning\nAs she stares into the glass, I'll be waiting\n'Cause she's lost inside the past\n(lost inside the past)\nFaded pictures in a broken glass (in a broken glass)\nLike a mirror revealing (I feel it)\nWhat the woman is feeling\nWas it someone from a distant past? (way back long ago)\n'Cause it's breaking my heart\n(You're breaking my... breaking my...)\nTo watch her stare into the glass (my heart is broke girl...)\nFaded pictures in a broken glass",
