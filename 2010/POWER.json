 "lyrics": "I'm living in that 21st century, doing something mean to it\nDo it better than anybody you ever seen do it\nScreams from the haters got a nice ring to it\nI guess every superhero need his theme music\n\nNo one man should have all that power\nThe clock\u2019s ticking, I just count the hours\nStop tripping, I'm tripping off the power\n(\n21st-century schizoid man\n)\n\nThe system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open\nWe ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling\nHuh? Motherfucker, we rolling\nWith some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands\nIn this white man world, we the ones chosen\nSo goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning\nHuh? I'll see you in the morning\nThis is way too much, I need a moment\n\nNo one man should have all that power\nThe clock's ticking, I just count the hours\nStop tripping, I'm tripping off the power\n'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours\nAnd they say, and they say\nAnd they say, and they say\nAnd they say, and they say\n(\n21st-century schizoid man\n)\n\nFuck SNL and the whole cast\nTell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass\nMore specifically, they can kiss my asshole\nI'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes\nYou short-minded niggas' thoughts is Napoleon\nMy furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in\nI embody every characteristic of the egotistic\nHe knows he's so fuckin' gifted\nI just needed time alone with my own thoughts\nGot treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault\nMy childlike creativity, purity, and honesty\nIs honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts\nReality is catching up with me\nTaking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody\nWith these responsibilities that they entrusted me\nAs I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece\n\nThinking no one man should have all that power\nThe clock's ticking, I just count the hours\nStop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder\n'Til then, fuck that, the world\u2019s ours\nAnd they say, and they say\nAnd they say, and they say\nAnd they say, and they say\n(\n21st-century schizoid man\n)\n\nColin Powells, Austin Powers\nLost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation\nThey say I was the abomination of Obama's nation\nWell, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation\nAt the end of the day, goddamnit, I'm killing this shit\nI know damn well y'all feeling this shit\nI don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick\nI ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?\nHow Ye doing? I'm survivin'\nI was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'\nWhere the bad bitches, huh? Where you hidin'?\nI got the power make your life so excitin'\n[Outro: Kanye West & \nDwele\n]\nNow this will be a beautiful death\nI'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go\nI'm letting everything go\nMmm, now this will be a beautiful death\nI'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go\nI'm letting everything go\nNow this will be a beautiful death\nJumping out the window, letting everything go\nLetting everything go\nYou got the power to let power go?\n(21st-century schizoid man)",
