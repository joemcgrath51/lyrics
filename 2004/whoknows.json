 "lyrics": "Now what we came here to do\nIt means more to me than just a night\nThat we'll share so make sure that you're prepared\nBaby and know that love is not just something to do\nIt's the moment that transcends\nOur physical into a more spiritual level of understanding\n\nAnd who knows somehow this night just might lead us\nInto a place where our emotions can grow if we let them go\nCause who knows what may happen if we act on our attractions\nAnd lose ourselves inside a world made for us and no one else\nHey girl just let me love you\n\nNow ain't no need to be afraid\nCause I'll be as gentle as it takes\nTo provide you with the right amount of pleasure and pain\nAnd I'll make sure that you feel alright\nEven if it takes me all night cause the joy is all mine\nNow when I know you're satisfied\nSo let's keep giving all we got\n\nWho knows somehow this night just might lead us\nInto a place where our emotions can grow if we let them go\nCause who knows what may happen if we act on our attractions\nAnd lose ourselves inside a world made for us and no one else\nHey girl just let me love you\n\nListen, now I can see it in your eyes, yeah\nThat you want to baby just as bad as I do\nAnd girl I wanna give it to you\nNow if you can just set aside your fears\nAnd just try to deal with\nWhat's going on with us right now\n\nWho knows somehow this night just might lead us\nInto a place where our emotions can grow if we let them go\nCause who knows what may happen if we act on our attractions\nAnd lose ourselves inside a world made for us and no one else\nHey girl just let me love you\nCause who knows somehow this night just might lead us\nInto a place where our emotions can grow if we let them go\nCause who knows what may happen if we act on our attractions\nAnd lose ourselves inside a world made for us and no one else\nHey girl just let me love you\nJust let me love you\nJust let me love you",
