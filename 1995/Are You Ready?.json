Oh-ah, oh-ah\n\nIf you move, you lose it\nSo baby, don't move too fast, no\nYou need to spend quality time if you wanna make it last, oh\nWhen you have a good thing, you know you gotta hold on tight\nOr you might miss my love in the middle of the night\n\nSo don\u2019t try to fight it\nBaby baby, can't you see\nYou can't deny it\nYou know you wanna be with me\nOur love's exciting, hoo\nBaby baby, we both know\nOh, oh baby, but remember this, that I can resist\nIf I don\u2019t want ya, baby\n\nSo if I show you what you're missing\nYou wanna come back to me\nWhat's the point in reminiscing?\nAre you ready for me? Oh-ah, oh-ah\nIf I show you what you're missing (if I show ya, show ya)\nYou wanna come back to me\nWhat's the point in reminiscing?\nAre you ready for me? Oh-ah, oh-ah\n\nAre you ready for me? 'Cause I'm ready for you\nAre you ready for me? I'll do what you want me to\nAre you ready for me? 'Cause I'm ready for you\nYes, I'm ready (oh-ah, oh-ah)\n\nIf I show you what you're missing (if I show ya)\nYou wanna come back to me (you wanna come back to me)\nWhat's the point in reminiscing?\nAre you ready for me? (are you ready for me, babe?)\nIf I show you what you're missing (if I show ya)\nYou wanna come back to me (you wanna come back to me, baby)\nWhat's the point in reminiscing?\nAre you ready for me? (are you ready for me, babe)\nIf I show you what you're missing\n(show you what you're missing, baby)\nYou wanna come back to me (back to me)\nWhat's the point in reminiscing? (point in reminiscing, baby)\nAre you ready for me? Oh-ah, oh-ah",
