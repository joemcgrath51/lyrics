YEAH!\n\nDiamond rings, pearls and things\nTrips in December\nThings we do for love\nFancy cars, the credit cards\nDo you remember?\nThings we do for love\n\nI showered you with gifts of love\nBut it was never enough\nTo bring you closer to me\nTricking money was no thing\nThe simple pleasure that you bring my way\nTakes me back to the day we were\n\nSailing on a cruise at night\n(Sailing on a cruise at night)\nGazing to the ocean under moonlight\n(Under moonlight)\nTaking you to paradise\n(Taking you to paradise)\nOOOOHHHHHHHH, YEAH! YEAH!\n\nDiamond rings, pearls and things\nTrips in December\nThings we do for love\nFancy cars, the credit cards\nDo you remember?\nThings we do for love",
