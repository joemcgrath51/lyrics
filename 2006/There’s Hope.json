 "lyrics": "Back when I had a little\nI thought that I needed a lot\nA little was over rated\nBut a lot was a little too complicated\nYou see, zero didn't satisfy me\nA million didn't make me happy\nThat's when I learned a lesson\nThat it's all about your perceptions\nHey-are you a pauper or a superstar\nSo you act, so you feel, so you are\nIt ain't about the size of your car\nIt's about the size of the faith in your heart\n\nThere's hope\nIt doesn't cost a thing to smile\nYou don't have to pay to laugh\nYou better thank God for that\nThere's hope\nIt doesn't cost a thing to smile\nYou don't have to pay to laugh\nYou better thank God for that\nThere's hope!\n\nOff in the back country of Brazil\nI met a young brother that made me feel\nThat I could accomplish anything\nYou see just like me he wanted to sing\nHe had no windows and no doors\nHe lived a simple life and was extremely poor\nOn top of all of that he had no eye sight\nBut that didn't keep him from seeing the light\nHe said, \"What's it like in the USA?\"\nAnd all I did was complain\nHe said, \"Living here is paradise.\"\nHe taught me paradise is in your mind\nYou know that\n\nThere's hope\nIt doesn't cost a thing to smile\nYou don't have to pay to laugh\nYou better thank God for that\nThere's hope\nIt doesn't cost a thing to smile\nYou don't have to pay to laugh\nYou better thank God for that\nThere's hope!\n\nEvery time I turn on the T.V. (There's Hope)\nSomebody's acting crazy (There's Hope)\nIf you let it, it will drive you crazy (There's Hope)\nBut I'm takin' back my power today (There's Hope)\nGas prices they just keep on rising (There's Hope)\nThe government, they keep on lying\nBut we gotta keep on surviving\nKeep living our truth and do the best we can do, 'cos\n\nThere's hope\nIt doesn't cost a thing to smile\nYou don't have to pay to laugh\nYou better thank God for that\nThere's hope\nIt doesn't cost a thing to smile\nYou don't have to pay to laugh\nYou better thank God for that\nThere's hope\n\nStand up for your rights (echo)\nKeep shining your light (echo)\nAnd show the world your smile (echo)\nStand up for your rights (echo)\nKeep shining your light (echo)\nAnd show the world your smile (echo)\n\nThere's hope\nIt doesn't cost a thing to smile\nYou don't have to pay to laugh\nYou better thank God for that\nThere's hope\nIt doesn't cost a thing to smile\nYou don't have to pay to laugh\nYou better thank God for that\nThere's hope\n\nOne two one one two uh two\nOne two one one two uh two\nOne two one one two uh two\nOne two one one two uh two\nOne two one one two uh two",
