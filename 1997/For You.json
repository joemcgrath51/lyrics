 "lyrics": "For you I give a lifetime of stablility\nAnything you want of me\nNothing is impossible\nFor you there are no words\nOr ways to show my love\nOr all the thoughts I'm thinking of\n'Cause this life is no good alone\nSince we've become one\nI've made a change\nEverything I do now makes sense\nAll roads end, all I do is for you\nFor you I share the cup of love that overflows\nAnd anyone who knows us knows\nThat I would change all faults I have for you\nThere is no low or high or in between\nOf my heart that you Haven't seen\n'Cause I share all I have and am\nNothing I've said is hard to understand\nAll I feel I feel deeper still\nAnd always will all this love is for you\nEvery note that I play\nEvery word I might say\nEvery melody I feel\nAre only for you and your appeal\nEvery page that I write\nEveryday of my life\nWould not be filled without the things\nThat my love for you now brings\nFor you I'd make a promise of fidelity\nNow and for eternity\nNo one could replace this vow\nFor you I'd take your hand and heart\nAnd everything and add to them a wedding ring\n'Cause this life is no good alone\nSince we've become one you're all I know\nIf this feeling should leave I'd die and here's why\nAll I am is for you\nEverything I do now makes sense\nAll roads end, all I do...\nIs for you\nOnly for you",
