 "lyrics": "Closer to my dreams\nIt's coming over me\nI'm getting higher\nCloser to my dreams\nI'm getting higher and higher\nFeel it in my sleep\n\nSometimes it feels like I'll never go past here\nSometimes it feels like I'm stuck forever, ever\n (Like I'm stuck forever)\n\nBut I'm going higher\nCloser to my dreams\nI'm going higher and higher\nI can almost reach\n\nSometimes you just have to let it go (Let it go, let it go)\nLeaving all my fears to burn and die\nPush them all away so I can move on\nCloser to my dreams\nFeel it all over my being, in my being\nClose your eyes and seek what you believe\n\nI'm moving higher, higher, oh, oh\nI'm going higher and higher and higher and higher\nCloser to my dreams\n(Higher and higher, oh, oh)\n\nI'm moving upward and onward and beyond all that I could see\n(Stretching out my arms so I can reach)\nI'm so close it's like I can just reach\nI can feel my dreams\nCloser to my dreams\nI'm moving closer to my dreams\nOoh\n\nSometimes it feel like you'll never gonna change\n(Never gonna change)\nBut you never choose to walk away",
