 "lyrics": "Oh oh.. sometimes\nThe way I\nLove too much and I\nGive too much and ya\nTake so much\nTil I\nAin't got nothin'\nAnd your energy\nHow it weighs on me\nSteady\nDrainin' me\nUntil I'm empty\nWantin' better days\nAnd all your crazy ways\nAm I lovin' you in vain? Somebody to help me\nI don't need negativity\nI just need some clarity (sometimes I wanna love you) ooh ooh ooh\nSometimes\nI wanna hate you\nSometimes I wanna\nGrab you and pull you close and tell you I love you then push you away\nOh oh oh boy\nI wanna\nLove you\nAnd sometimes I wanna\nFight you\nAnd God knows that it ain't\nRight to\nI tell you I'm leavin' and then I say\nOh oh sometimes\nNow I give my all\nEvery time you fall\nI'm right there whenever you need me\nThat's when I'm\nPositive\nYou're insensitive\nAnd just\nKnowing this\nI'm uneasy\nDon't appreciate\nSacrifice I made\nMoney that\nI threw away\nNot a dime on me\nBut all I see\nIs negativity\nI think I'm getting clarity\nAm I asking too much?\nWhen I need for you to hold me just to make me feel better\nAm I asking too much?\nWhen I'm asking for the little things you do to bring me laughter\nAm I asking too much?\nI can't wait another minute\n'cause I'm runnin' on empty\nWhen I long for your touch\nYour touch, your touch, your touch, your touch (sometimes I wanna love you )\nSometimes I wanna\nHate you\nSometimes I wanna\nGrab you and pull you close and tell you I love you then push you away\nOh oh oh boy I wanna\nLove you\nAnd sometimes I wanna\nFight you (I wanna fight ya right now ...oh oh oh oh oh... I wanna make ya leave)\nAnd God knows that it ain't\nRight to\nI tell you I'm leavin' and then I say\nOh oh sometimes\nMake you leave... Far to believe...\nI wanna stretch my arms and I fall to my knees that's when the heavens open up and pour a blessing on me.... Sometimes sometimes oh you make me so mad sometimes I wanna love you I wanna love you\nSometimes I wanna hate you, sometimes I wanna grab you and pull you close and tell you I love you then push you away, oh oh oh boy I wanna love you, sometimes I wanna fight (fight ya right now) you and God knows that it ain't right to I tell you one minute and then I say oh oh sometimes",
