(Remember this)\nAnd it's gonna make us smile (Make us smile)\n'Cause in the end we stayed down\n\nI ain't gon' lie, at times you amaze me\nYou be talking and I swear that you're crazy\nBut, I learned a long time ago\nThat pride don't help, it only hurts\nAnd I just want you to know\nI need you, baby (I need you)\nI'm just like Weezy, baby (Baby)\nNot Weezy like the son of Baby\nBut the wife of George and we're moving on up\nTen years strong and we're looking like a plan\nI'm looking like your woman and you're looking like my man\nWe looking like real and the haters look fake\nEspecially when they hear me say\n\nStay down\n(We're almost to the very best part)\nStay down\n(You'll always have a place in my heart)\nStay down\n(We too can pass the test)\nStay down\n(You know we gotta lot of work)\nStay down\n(I know it ain't been the best but it certainly ain't been the worst)\nStay down\n(The drama will not last forever)\nStay down\n(We'll beat it long as we're together)\nOne day we'll look back on this\nWe'll be like \"Remember this\"?\nAnd it's gonna make us smile (Make us smile)\n'Cause in the end we stayed down (Stayed down)\n\nUnderstand you are the one in my heart\nAnd I'm holding yours so we can't live apart\nWhen things stop making sense we'll figure it out\nI walked into this and I don't wanna walk out no, no\nEverything ain't gonna be how we like\nAnd what is worth keeping if it didn't take a fight?\nYour healing is in me, and my healing is in you\nSo get your mind right 'cause here's what we're gonna do\n\nStay down\n(We're almost to the very best part)\nStay down\n(You'll always be the pride in my heart)\nStay down\n(We too can pass the test)\nStay down\n(You know we gotta lot of work)\nStay down\n(I know it ain't been the best but it certainly ain't been the worst)\nStay down\n(The drama will not last forever)\nStay down\n(We'll beat it long as we're together)\nOne day we'll look back on this\nWe'll be like \"Remember this\"?\nAnd it's gonna make us smile. (Make us smile)\nCause in the end we stayed down (Stay down)\n\nDid you know, did you know, did you know, did you know\nDid you know, did you know, did you know\nThat I love you\nDid you know, did you know, did you know, did you know",
