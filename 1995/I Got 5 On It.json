No, he ain't my homie to begin with\nIt's too many heads to be poppin' to let my friend hit it\nBit unless you pull out the fat, crispy\nFive-dollar bill, on the real, before it's history\n\u2018Cause fools be havin' them vacuum lungs\nAnd if you let 'em hit it for free, you hella dumb-da-dumb-dumb\nI come to school with the Taylor on my earlobe\nAvoiding all the thick teasers, skeezers, and weirdos\nThat be blowing off the land, like, \"Where the bomb at?\"\nGive me two bucks, you take a puff, and pass my bomb back\nSuck up that dank like a Slurpee, the serious\nBomb will make a niggy go delirious, like Eddie Murphy\nI got more growing pains than Maggie\n\u2018Cause homies nag me to take the dank out of the baggie\n\nI got five on it (got it, good), grab your four, let's get keyed\nI got five on it, messin' with that Indo weed\nI got five on it (got it, good), it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back\nI got five on it, partner, let's go half on a sack\n\nI take sacks to the\nFace whenever I can, don't need no crutch\nI'm so keyed up till the joint be burning my hand\nNext time I roll it in a hampa to burn\nSlow, so the ashes won't be burning up my hand, bruh\nHoochies can hit, but they know they got to pitch in\nThen I roll a joint that's longer than your extension (hahaha)\n\u2018Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free\nHell no! You better bring your own spliff, chief\nWhat's up? Don't babysit that, better pass the\nJoint, stop hitting, \u2018cause you know you got asthma\nCrack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it\n\u2018Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely\nI gotta take a whiz test to my P. O\nI know I failed, \u2018cause I done smoked major weed, bro\nAnd every time we with Chris, that fool rollin' up a\nFatty, but the Tanqueray straight had me\n\nI got five on it; grab your four, let's get keyed\nI got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed\nI got five on it; it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back\nI got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack\n\nAyy, make this right, mane, stop at the light, mane\nMy yester-night thing got me hung off the night train\nYou fade, I fade, so let's head to the East\nHit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashish\nI wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low budget\nStill rollin' a two-door Cutlass, same old bucket\nFoggy windows, soggy Indo\nI'm in the 'land getting smoked with my kinfolk\n\nI been smoked\nYuk'll spray ya, lay you down up in the O-A-K\nThe Town, homies don't play around, we down to blaze a pound\nThen ease up, speed up through the E-S-O\nDrink the V-S-O-P up, with a lemon squeeze up\nAnd everybody's rolled up, I'm the roller\nThat's quick to fold a blunt out of a bunch of sticky doja\nHold up, suck up my weed is all you do\nKick in feed, \u2018cause where I be we needs half, like Umfufu\n\nI got five on it; grab your four, let's get keyed\nI got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed\nI got five on it; it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back\nI got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack",
