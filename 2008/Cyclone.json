She get lower than a muffler\nEither with her girlfriends or showstoppin' with her hustler\nThe way she move her body, she might see the Maserati\nShe wanna put it on me, tryin' to show me her tsunami\nShe make it hard to copy, always tight and never sloppy\nAnd got an entourage and her own paparazzi\nNow, there she go again, ridin' through the stormy weather\nYou better button up, if you wanna go get her\nCause it is what it is, everybody wanna love her\nBut when she pop it, boy, you better run for cover\n\nShe moves her body like a cyclone\nAnd she makes me wanna do it all night long\nGoing hard when they turn the spotlights on\nBecause she moves her body like a cyclone\nJust like a cyclone\nShe moves her body like a cyclone\nAnd she makes me wanna do it all night long\nGoing hard when they turn the spotlights on\nBecause she moves her body like a cyclone\nThe mighty cyclone\n\nIt's a rap when she breakin' boys off the typhoon (It's a rap)\nGotta get that feta like a boss tycoon (It's a rap)\nNow hold it steady, cause she make a monsoon (It's a rap)\nNow you can Google, download to iTunes\nSee, what I'm sayin', she ain't playin'\nBet she got them heads turnin'\nYou gon' hear it clack-clack when them heels get to burnin'\nStiletto so fuego, she got her own label\nAnd got us all doin' her tomato\n\nShe moves her body like a cyclone\nAnd she makes me wanna do it all night long\nGoing hard when they turn the spotlights on\nBecause she moves her body like a cyclone\nJust like a cyclone\nShe moves her body like a cyclone\nAnd she makes me wanna do it all night long\nGoing hard when they turn the spotlights on\nBecause she moves her body like a cyclone\nThe mighty cyclone\n\nShawty got looks and shawty got class\nShawty got hips and shawty got ass\nWhen she hit the stage, she drop it down low like\nErrr rerr rer rer rer rer rer rerr rerrr\nAy, this is crazy, it's amazing\nShe must be the one, the lady\nErrr rerr rer rer rer rer rer rerr rerrr, ahh\n\nShe moves her body like a cyclone\nAnd she makes me wanna do it all night long\nGoing hard when they turn the spotlights on\nBecause she moves her body like a cyclone\nJust like a cyclone\nShe moves her body like a cyclone\nAnd she makes me wanna do it all night long\nGoing hard when they turn the spotlights on\nBecause she moves her body like a cyclone\nThe mighty cyclone\n\nErrr rerr rer rer rer rer rer rerr rerrr\nErrr rerr rer rer rer rer rer rerr rerrr\nErrr rerr rer rer rer rer rer rerr rerrr\nOhh",
