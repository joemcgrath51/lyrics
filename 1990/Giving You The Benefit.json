(Work, work, work.)\nBaby, work it on, work in on out.  (Work, work.)\nOooh, oooh, oooh, oooh\nBaby, how could you be hanging out on a diamond queen\nAin't you missing me, poor little me\nWhen you knew all the time that you could've been with your home girl loving and a-kissing on me\nSweet little me\nBut don't you know if you wanna be a man\nYou gotta work real hard\nIf you wanna make me feel like I'm your number one\nThen nothing in the world should make us part\n'Cause we can make it work if you take away the hurt from my heart\nI'll be giving you the benefit on the doubt\nAnd I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out\nI'll be giving you the benefit on the doubt\nAnd I'm giving you a minute to try to work it on out\nBaby, work it on, work it on out.  (Work, work, work.)\nWork it, baby\n(Work, work.) Keep trying to work it on, work it on, work it on, work it on out\n(Work, work, work.) Work it, baby\n(Work, work.) Keep trying to work it on out.  Mmmm\n(Oh.) I can be a trip, but I choose not to\n(Oh, oh.) Deep inside of you, I think there's still good in you, boy\n(Oh.) Don't give me no reason not to trust you\n(Oh, oh.) Just take the benefit\nDon't give me no lip and I'll be sweet to you\nG-G-Giving you, giving you\nG-G-Giving you, giving you\nG-G-Giving you, giving you\nG-G-Giving you, giving you\nG-G-Giving you, giving you\nG-G-Giving you, giving you\nG-G-Giving you, giving you\nG-G-Giving you, giving you\nGiving you, giving you, giving you, giving you, giving you\nGiving you, giving you, giving you, giving you, giving you\nGiving you, giving you, giving you, giving you, giving you\nGiving you, giving you, giving you, giving you, giving you\n(Work.) Giving you, giving you, giving you, giving you\n(Work.) Giving you, giving you, giving you, giving you\n(Work.) Giving you, giving you, giving you, giving you\n(Work.)
