Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue\nIf I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move\nI never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people\nEverybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people\nI'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming\nWatched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy\nSome shit that I feel for\nI been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden\nThey say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it\n\nYoung age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)\nBig stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)\nBig wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)\nRidin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest\nI know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry\nYou know what it was, I told you that I was heartless\nI'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault\nBut don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt\nYoung age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)\nBig stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)\nBig wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)\nRidin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest\nI know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry\nYou know what it was, I told you that I was heartless\nI'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault\nBut don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt",
