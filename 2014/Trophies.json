Can I tell the truth?\nIf I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove\nNah, this for me though\nI'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people\nAnd they don't have no award for that\nTrophies, trophies\nAnd they don't have no award for that\nShit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open\nI just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga\n\nBitch I go to Dreams with a suitcase\nI got my whole country on a new wave\nShe like, \"I heard all your niggas stay where you stay\"\nHouse so big I haven't seen them boys in two days\nBitch, I use a walkie-talkie just to get a beverage\nI saw my parents split up right after the wedding\nThat taught my ass to stay committed, fuck the credit\nBitch, check the numbers, I'm the one who really get it\n\nI told y'all mu'fuckas\nMan, this shit is not a love song\nThis a \"doing-me-and-only-God-can-judge\" song\n\"I-do-not-know-what-the-fuck-you-thought-it-was\" song\n\"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub\" song\nNigga, \"just-because\" song\nDamn\n\nWhat's the move? Can I tell the truth?\nIf I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove\nNah, this for me though\nI'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people\nAnd they don't have no award for that\nTrophies, trophies\nAnd they don't have no award for that\nShit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open\nI just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga",
