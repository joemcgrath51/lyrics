 "lyrics": "Imagine seeing him on the town holding another hand\nShe\u2019s staring me down\nSo I figure that he told her who I am\nBut it don\u2019t matter either way\nWhat they do or say\n\u2018cause ain\u2019t nothing changed\nHe\u2019s standing with her\nBut his soul is calling out my name\nChorus\nI\nn my mind I\u2019ll always be his lady\nIn my mind I\u2019ll always be his girl\nSaw his mama just the other\nSaid he\u2019d been through a spell\n\u2018Had a bad break up\nThinks he\u2019s on his way up\nIt\u2019s hard to tell\nShe said\nI think it\u2019d do some good if you call him every now and then\nYou see he\u2019s been through some things and I\u2019m thinking\nHe could really use a friend\nChorus\nIn my mind I\u2019ll always be his lady\nIn my mind I\u2019ll always be his girl\nOnly time will tell if I\u2019m his lady\nBut in my mind, I\u2019ll always be his girl\nBridge\nThey say if you love something\nYou\u2019ve got to let it go\nAnd if it comes back\nThen it means so much more\nBut if it never does\nAt least you will know\nThat it was something you had to go through\nTo grow\nChorus\nIn my mind I\u2019ll always be his lady\nIn my mind I\u2019ll always be his girl\nOnly time will tell if I\u2019m his lady\nBut in my mind, I\u2019ll always be his girl",
