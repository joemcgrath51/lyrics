 "lyrics": "You know\nWe can't do this\nWe just can't\nListen\n\nYou say you feel disenchanted\nCause lately he takes you for granted\nStill faithful and true you remained and\nTo hurt so have I\nYou pour out your heart and I listen\nAnd we catch a vibe reminiscing\nTemptations so strong not to mention\nThe yearning inside\n\nBut what kind of man would I be\nIf I lived unfaithfully\nAnd what kind of girl would you be\nIf you did the same\nCause I don't wanna see her cry\nAnd you don't need a reason to lie\nCause if we laid down tonight\nIt won't justify throwing love aside\n\nThis feeling is strong and we know it\nBut we gotta see past the moment\nThere's too much to lose if we blow it\nThis is no lie\nStill, here we are both together\nWith promises made that we never\nYet feeling it now more than ever\nI can't deny\n\nBut what kind of man would I be\nIf I lived unfaithfully\nAnd what kind of girl would you be\nIf you did the same\nCause I don't wanna see her cry\nAnd you don't need a reason to lie\nCause if we laid down tonight\nIt won't justify throwing love aside\n\nHere we are all alone\nBut somehow we've got to stay strong\n\nBut what kind of man would I be\nIf I lived unfaithfully\nAnd what kind of girl would you be\nIf you did the same\nCause I don't wanna see her cry\nAnd you don't need a reason to lie\nCause if we laid down tonight\nIt won't justify throwing love aside\n\nYeahhh\n\nMakes me wanna say oh\nJust gotta say oh\nShe makes me wanna say oh\nJust gotta say oh\nBut what kind of man would I be, oh I can't be unfaithful\nSorry baby",
