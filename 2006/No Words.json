 "lyrics": "The things you say you do,you don't do\nIn fact it's just the opposite of all of the words that come from you\nAnd sometimes I sit around waiting you say you'll come but you never show\nThat's not the way you treat your woman\nThe promises you make, you don't keep\nInstead you go and do the very thing you know that hurts me\nWhat I'm trying to get you to see is that your better half has needs\nYou don't have to say a word to me baby just\nShow me, you love me, and you won't have to say a word\nJust show me, you love me, and you won't have to say a word\nI don't wanna let you go, breaking up would be upsurd\nIf you just show me you love me, then you don't have to say a word\nLike sometimes you say you right, but you'll be wrong\nAnd still I take the blame, tuck all my pain\nCause I don't wanna argue all night long\nOh I toss and turn through the night\nThe morning comes and you're still not by my side\nThat's not the way you treat your woman\nSaid you would be faithful, but I can't tell\nIn fact you show me things that lets me know, that your heart is somewhere else\nWhat I'm trying to get you to see is that your better half has needs\nYou don't have to say one word to me baby just\nShow me, you love me, and you won't have to say a word\nJust show me, you love me, and you won't have to say a word\nWord, word, word, you won't have to say a word\nWord, you won't have to say a word oh naw baby\nYou won't have to say a word, word\nYou don't have to say a word no no\nJust show me you love, and you won't have to say a word\nHey just show me that you love me\nAw baby sometimes you gotta show me\nHey she said all you gotta do is pick up the phone and call me sometimes\nShe said take me to the club with you sometime\nCan you take me out to dinner with you sometime?\nSend me a bouquet of flowers sometime\nGet up off your lazy ass and go to work sometimes\nCancel hanging out with your boys and stay in with me sometimes\nI'm your woman, act like it sometimes\nAll I ask is that you take care of business sometimes\nCan you take the trash out for me sometimes\nCan you get in the kitchen and wash the dishes sometime",
