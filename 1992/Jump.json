Real high 'cause I'm just so fly\nA young lovable, huggable type of guy\nAnd everything is to the back with a little slack\n'Cause inside out, it's wiggida wiggida wiggida wack\nI come stompin' with somethin' pumpin' to keep you jumpin'\nR&B rap is bullcrap is what I'm dumpin'\nAin't nuthin' soft about Kris Kross, we all that\nSo when they ask, \"Do they rock?,\" say, \"Believe that!\"\n\n(Jump Jump)\nThe Mac Dad'll make ya (Jump jump)\nThe Daddy Mac'll make ya (Jump jump)\nKris Kross'll make ya (Jump jump)\nUh huh, uh huh\n(Jump jump)\nThe Mac Dad'll make ya (Jump jump)\nThe Daddy Mac'll make ya (Jump jump)\nKris Kross'll make ya (Jump jump)\n\nI like my stuff knockin' (Knockin')\nI love it when the girlies be like jockin' (Jockin')\nThe D-A-double D-Y-M-A-C\nYeah, you know me\nI got you jumpin' an' bumpin' an' pumpin' movin' all around, G\nIn the mix, I made MC's step back\nThey tried to step to the Mac then they got jacked\nTo the back you'll be sportin' the gear; is that coincidental?\nAct like you know and don't be claiming that it's mental\nTwo lil' kids with a flow you ain't ever heard\nAnd nuthin' fake and you can understand every word (Word, hahaha)\nAs you listen to my cool, smooth melody\nThe Daddy makes you J-U-M-P\n\n(Jump Jump)\nThe Mac Dad'll make ya (Jump jump)\nThe Daddy Mac'll make ya (Jump jump)\nKris Kross'll make ya (Jump jump)\nUh huh, uh huh\n(Jump jump)\nThe Mac Dad'll make ya (Jump jump)\nThe Daddy Mac'll make ya (Jump jump)\nKris Kross'll make ya (Jump jump)\n\nNow, the formalities of this and that\nIs that Kris Kross ain't comin' off wack\nAnd for all y'all suckas that don't know\nCheck it out\nSome of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this (Bo, bo)\nSome of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this (Bo, bo)\nSome of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this (Bo, bo)\nSome of them try to rhyme but they can't (Bo, bo)\n'Cause I'm the miggity miggity miggity miggity Mac Daddy (Bo, bo)\nThe miggity miggity miggity miggity Mac (Bo, bo)\n'Cause I'm the miggity miggity miggity miggity Mac Daddy (Bo, bo)\nThe miggity miggity miggity miggity Mac (Bo, bo)\nI make you wanna\n\n(Jump jump)\nThe Mac Dad'll make ya (Jump jump)\nThe Daddy Mac'll make ya (Jump jump)\nKris Kross'll make ya (Jump jump)\nUh huh, uh huh\n(Jump jump)\nThe Mac Dad'll make ya (Jump jump)\nThe Daddy Mac'll make ya (Jump jump)\nKris Kross'll make ya (Jump jump)\n(Jump jump)\nThe Mac Dad'll make ya (Jump jump)\nThe Daddy Mac'll make ya (Jump jump)\nKris Kross'll make ya (Jump jump)\nUh huh, uh huh\n(Jump jump)\nThe Mac Dad'll make ya (Jump jump)\nThe Daddy Mac'll make ya (Jump jump)\nKris Kross'll make ya (Jump jump)\n(Jump jump)\nThe Mac Dad'll make ya (Jump jump)\nThe Daddy Mac'll make ya (Jump jump)\nKris Kross'll make ya (Jump jmp)\nUh huh, uh huh\n(Jump jump)\nThe Mac Dad'll make ya (Jump jump)\nThe Daddy Mac'll make ya (Jump jump)\nKris Kross'll make ya (Jump jump)\n\nBelieve that!",
