 "lyrics": "You say you got a girl\nYeah, how you want me? How you want me when you got a girl?\nThe feelin' is reckless\n, of knowin' it's selfish\nAnd knowin' I'm desperate\nGettin' all in your love, fallin' all over love, like\nDo it 'til it hurts less\nHangin' out the back, all up in your lap\nLike is you comin' home? Is you out with her?\nI don't care, long as you're here by 10:30, no later than\nDrop them drawers, give me what I want\n\nMy man is my man, is your man, heard it's her man too\nMy man is my man, is your man, heard that's her man\nTuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday\nI just keep him satisfied through the weekend\nYou like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend, oh-oh\nMake him lose his mind every weekend\nYou take Wednesday, Thursday, then just send him my way\nThink I got it covered for the weekend\n\nI gotta say, I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that\nI mean, I'm sayin', what kind of tease is two days?\nI need me at least 'bout four of them, more of them\nMore you on me, on us, just tell me you want me, yeah\nMonday and I'll be at your door, ready to take her place\nReady to give you, what you've been missin' on weekdays\nWhat you've been waitin' for, 10:30, no later than\nDrop them drawers, I know what you want\n\nMy man is my man, is your man, heard it's her man too\nMy man is my man, is your man, heard that's her man\nTuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday\nI just keep him satisfied through the weekend\nYou like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend\nMake him lose his mind every weekend\nYou take Wednesday, Thursday (Don't worry 'bout none)\nThen just send him my way (Don't worry 'bout none)\nThink I got it covered for the weekend\n\nAyyy\nBright ideas, we've got bright ideas\nAyyy (Ooh)\nBright ideas, we've got bright ideas\nAyyy (Ooh)\nBright ideas, we've got bright ideas",
