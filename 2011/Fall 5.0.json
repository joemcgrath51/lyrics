 "lyrics": "I see it clearly\nEven if I was blind\nYou've got me really\nGoing out of my mind\nThings that you whisper\nSoft in my ear\nWords I've been wanting\nSo long to hear\nI don't know if it's real\nBut I know how I feel it's\nSo crazy, so amazing\nYou can take me now\n\nGot my back against the wall\nFeels like I'm standing ten feet tall\nOn the ledge too close to call\nIf you push I just might fall\nI just might fall\nI just might fall\nI just might fall\nI just might fall\n\nWhen you're not near me\nI long for your touch\nWhen you're right here with me\nI can't get enough\nThe way I used to think girl\nWill never be the same\nCause you reside deeply\nIn my heart and my brain\nI don't know if it's real\nBut I know how I feel it's\nSo amazing, so crazy\nI can't shake you now\n\nGot my back against the wall\nFeels like I'm standing ten feet tall\nOn the ledge too close to call\nIf you push I just might fall\nI just might fall\nI just might fall\nI just might fall\nI just might fall\n\nEach and every moment\nWithout you, is a moment\nThinking about you\nAnd I know\nNothing will never be the same\nWaited a lifetime\nTo find you\nJust wanna stay right beside you\nI won't let it slip away\n\nGot my back against the wall\nFeels like I'm standing ten feet tall\nOn the ledge too close to call\nBut if you push I just might fall\nI just might fall\nI just might fall\nI just might fall\nI just might fall",
