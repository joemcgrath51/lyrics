 "lyrics": "Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain\nMy girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain\nShe needs something to change, need to take off the e-e-edge\nSo fuck it all tonight\nAnd don't tell me to shut up\nWhen you know you talk too much\nBut you don't got shit to say (Say)\n\nI want you out of my head\nI want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)\nThere's no way I could save you (Save you)\n'Cause I need to be saved too\nI'm no good at goodbyes\n\nWe're both actin' insane, but too stubborn to change\nNow I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins\nAnd my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge\nDon't fuck with me tonight\nSay you needed this heart, then you got it (Got it)\nTurns out that it wasn't what you wanted (Wanted)\nAnd we wouldn't let go and we lost it\nNow I'm a goner\n\nI want you out of my head (Head)\nI want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)\nThere's no way I could save you (Save you)\n'Cause I need to be saved too (Saved too)\nI'm no good at goodbyes\n\nI want you out of my life\nI want you back here tonight\nI'm tryna cut you, no knife\nI wanna slice you and dice you\nMy argue possessive, it got you precise\nCan you not turn off the TV? I'm watchin' the fight\nI flood the garage, blue diamond, no shark\nYou're Barbie life doll, it's Nicki Minaj\nYou don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger\nI just wanna see the side, the one that's unbothered (Yeah)\nAnd I don't want ya to never go outside (Outside)\nI promise if they play, my niggas slidin' (Slidin')\nI'm fuckin' her, and the tour bus still ridin' (Ridin')\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nI want you out of my head (Head)\nI want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)\nThere's no way I could save you (Save you)\n'Cause I need to be saved too (Saved too)\nI'm no good at goodbyes\n[Outro: Post Malone & \nYoung Thug\n]\nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye (\nBye, bye\n)\nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye (\nBye, bye\n)\n(\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n)\nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye (\nBye, bye, bye\n)\nI'm no good at goodbyes\nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye (\nBye, bye\n)\nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye (\nBye, bye\n)\nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye (\nBye, bye\n)\nI'm no good at goodbyes",
