You all grown up now\nDoin' ya singin' thing the charts sewed up now\nWell you know I do my rap thing, I'm holdin' it down\nAnd I knew that me and you was gon' connect somehow\nYour people called for this track, it ain't no trouble to me\nI dreamt that you and me got married \non the WB\nYou on channel 11\n; I carry the M-11\nRJ, call the reverend; it's a match made in heaven\nWhatever have you I let you know\nI'm from soundview\nDown til I found you\nI'm tryin' to be around you\nI'm still comin' up\nChasin' the fame and wealth\nI could spoil you with time; you got everything else\n\nI'm still New York to the heart\nBut got love for all\nWhen I first saw this girl\nThought I wanted to fall\nMean the hummer so stunnin'\nThat my bod was tense\nAnd I was wishin everyday that I was fresh like Prince\nThen I came across my man RJ parlayin' in a 6\nWith Tatyana Ali playin'\nI heard Steely Dan \"Black Cow\" and went wild\nYo, tell me how can I get down\nThat's when they threw me on the redeye to LA\nI dirtied my cash and peeps back\nAnd hit Shaq on the cellay\nCourtside seats so close that we could touch\nTatyana and Lord and Peter Gunz, like what\n\nAll day long I think of you\nI can't even think of things to do\nWishin' all of my daydreams come true\nNow, baby, what am I to do?",
