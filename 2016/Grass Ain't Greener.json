 "lyrics": "You ain't the girl that you used to be\nYou say you're done, you're moving on\nThis ain't the world that it used to be\nLooks like you've won, looks like you've won\nSick of leaving messages on your cell\nA true lover, but when I\u2019m not there\nGirl, you had somebody that really cared\nHow you fuck it up, girl, it's not fair\n\nYou used to be the one to talk to on the side\nWaiting for my love to break up\nIt's crazy how your ass can walk through every night\nActing like you been a player\nThat grass ain't greener on the other side\nOh, yeah\nThat grass ain't greener on the other side\nOh, yeah\n\nSeems like ain't nothing cool about being real\nNo one's honest about what they feel\nTake a hoe and try to treat her well\nShe'll be back up at the club again\nI know what you want, but you're not gon' get it\n'Less I know for sure that you're vibing with me\nYou do what you want with somebody else\nI'm gone, baby\n\nYou used to be the one to talk to on the side\nWaiting for my love to break up\nIt's crazy how your ass can walk through every night\nActing like you been a player\nThat grass ain't greener on the other side, I've been there\nOh yeah, I've been there\nThat grass ain't greener on the other side\nOh yeah\n\nMy homie said I need to stop it\nMy momma said bitches be watchin' you\nThey gon' put their hand all in your pocket\nFor the credit card that's in your wallet\nDrinkin' liquor when we celebratin'\nCalculatin' all my funds\nTryna get a nigga take the condom off\n'Cause she want that tax every month, woo\nI know what you want, but you're not gon' get it\nTake my kindness for weakness when you act sadity\nKeeping it 100 ain't your fort\u00e9\nYou used to be\n\nYou used to be the one to talk to on the side\nWaiting for my love to break up\nIt's crazy how your ass can walk through every night\nActing like you been a player\nThat grass ain't greener on the other side\nOh yeah\nThat grass ain't greener on the other side\nOh yeah",
