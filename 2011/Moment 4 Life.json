 "lyrics": "I fly with the stars in the skies\nI am no longer trying to survive\nI believe that life is a prize\nBut to live doesn't mean you're alive\nDon't worry 'bout me and who I fire\nI get what I desire, it's my empire\nAnd yes, I call the shots, I am the umpire\nI sprinkle holy water upon a vampire\nIn this very moment, I'm king\nIn this very moment, I slayed Goliath with a sling\nThis very moment, I bring\nPut it on everything that I will retire with the ring\nAnd I will retire with the crown, yes\nNo, I'm not lucky, I'm blessed, yes\nClap for the heavyweight champ, me\nBut I couldn't do it all alone, we\nYoung Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley\nSouthside Jamaica, Queens, and it's crazy\n'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me\nShout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me\nAin't being cocky, we just vindicated\nBest believe that when we done, this moment will be syndicated\nI don't know, this night just remind me of\nEverything they deprived me of (Yeah)\nPut your drinks up\nIt's a celebration every time we link up\nWe done did everything they can think of\nGreatness is what we on the brink of\n\nI wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life\n'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive\nI wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life\nThis is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive\n\nWhat I tell them hoes? Bow, bow, bow to me, drop down to your knees\nYoung Money the mafia, that's word to Lil' Cease\nI'm in the Dominican, Big Papi Ortiz\nDoing target practice, all these bitches just aiming to please\nShout out to the CEO, 500 Degreez\nShout out to the OVO, red wings and fatigues, oh\nNiggas wanna be friends, how coincidental\nThis supposed to be y'all year? We ain't get the memo\nA young king, pay me in gold\n40 got a bunch of weed he ain't even roll\nThese niggas be droppin' songs, they ain't even cold\nWeezy on top, and that nigga ain't even home yet\nYeah, be very afraid\nThese other rappers gettin' bodied and carried away\nFuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today\nAnd all you bitches that be hatin' can catch a bouquet, ooh\nYeah, you a star in my eyes\nYou and all them white girls, party of five\nAre we drinking a lil' more? I can hardly decide\nI can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear\nDamn, this one for the books, man\nI swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man\nI'm really tryna make it more than what it is\n'Cause everybody dies, but not everybody lives, ah\n\nI wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life\n'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive\nI wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life\nThis is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive\n\nThis is my moment\nI waited all my\nLife, I can tell it's time\nDrifting away, I'm\nOne with the sunsets\nI have become alive\n\nI wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life\n'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive\nI wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life\nThis is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive",
