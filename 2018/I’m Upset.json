(Skrr)\nThat's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect\n\nGot a lot of blood and it's cold\nThey keep tryna get me for my soul (For my soul)\nThankful for the women that I know\nCan't go fifty-fifty with no ho (Ayy, ayy)\nEvery month\nShe don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front (Front)\nShe gon' try and settle outta court and make a run\nThen gon' ask me how I'm doin'?\n\nI'm upset ('Set, 'set)\nHalf a million on my head I can accept, yeah\n'Least it makes me feel like someone tried their best, yeah\nWant to waste a half a million, be my guest\nMade me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (Skrr)\nBut I'm blessed, I just checked (Checked, checked)\nHate me, never met me in the flesh (Flesh)\nSaid she's got some things she gotta come here and collect\nThat shit is in a box to the left, to the left (Left, left, left)\n\nGot a lot of blood and it's cold\nThey keep tryna get me for my soul (For my soul)\nThankful for the women that I know (That I know)\nCan't go fifty-fifty with no ho",
