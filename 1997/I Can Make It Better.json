So baby...\n\nWhenever you want me to\nI can make it better\nI just need this one chance to prove it to you\nI can make it better\nAnd oh baby, baby\nDon't be a pawn in his game\nGo 'head and tell him it's over, tell him to go\nOr darling, it's just a shame\n\nBetter for you is better for me\nLet's fall in love, and I'll make you see, baby\nBetter for you is better for, better for me, baby\nLet's fall in love, I'll make you, I'll make you see\n\nNever again will you hear a lie\nNever again will you wanna cry\nNever, oh no, will there be a teardrop in your eye\nStop all this madness in the name of love\nTell him to leave 'cause enough is enough\nLet him go, baby, and you can save your love for me\nTell him you've found somebody\nWho'll give you the love that you just won't believe\n\nWhatever you're going through\nI can make it better\nNo one should be making you feel like you do\nI can make it better\nAnd oh baby, baby\nDon't be a link in his chain\nGo 'head and tell him it's over, tell him to go\nOh darling, it's just a shame\nIt's better for you, ooh, better for you\n(I can make it better for you)\nBetter for you, so much better for you\n(I can make it better, yeah, babe)\nBetter for you, yeah yeah, better for you\n(I can make it better for you)\nBetter for you, hey, better for you\n(I can make it better, yeah, babe)\nBetter for you, better for you\n(I can make it better for you)\nBetter for you, better for you\n(I can make it better, yeah, babe)",
