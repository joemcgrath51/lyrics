Leave a good tip\nI'ma blow off my money and don't give two shits, oh-oh\n\nI'm on the floor, floor\nI love to dance\nSo give me more, more\n'Til I can't stand\nGet on the floor, floor\nLike it's your last chance\nIf you want more, more\nThen here I am\n\nStarships, were meant to fly\nHands up, and touch the sky\nCan't stop 'cause we're so high\nLet's do this one more time\nStarships, were meant to fly\nHands up, and touch the sky\nLet's do this one last time\nCan't stop...\n\nWe're higher than a motherfucka\nWe're higher than a motherfucka\nWe're higher than a motherfucka\n\nJump in my hoopty-hoopty-hoop\nI own that\nAnd I ain't payin' my rent this month\nI owe that\nBut fuck who you want, and fuck who you like\nDancehall life, there's no end in sight\nTwinkle, twinkle little star\nNow everybody let me hear you say ray, ray, ray\nNow spend all your money, 'cause today payday\nAnd if you're a G, you a G-G-G\nMy name is Onika, you can call me Nicki\n\nGet on the floor, floor\nLike it's your last chance\nIf you want more, more\nThen here I am\n\nStarships, were meant to fly\nHands up, and touch the sky\nCan't stop 'cause we're so high\nLet's do this one more time\nStarships, were meant to fly\nHands up, and touch the sky\nLet's do this one last time\nCan't stop...\n\nWe're higher than a motherfucka\nWe're higher than a motherfucka\nWe're higher than a motherfucka\n\nStarships, were meant to fly\nHands up, and touch the sky\nCan't stop 'cause we're so high\nLet's do this one more time\nStarships, were meant to fly\nHands up, and touch the sky\nLet's do this one last time\nCan't stop...\n\nWe're higher than a motherfucka\nWe're higher than a motherfucka\nWe're higher than a motherfucka",
