 "lyrics": "Sure I've been in love a time or two\nBut in the end I still chose you\nNo one could ever make me feel this way\nThat's why it's killing me, what we're going through\nSomehow thought 'tween me and you\nOur love would stand the test of time and never ever fade\n\nBut we're not making love no more\nWe're not even trying to change\nTell me how it slips away\nDoes it ever stay the same?\nWe don't even talk no more\nWe've ran out of words to say\nTell me it don't have to change\nWon't it ever stay the same?\n(Oh yeah, oh yeah, baby)\n\nGirl, I know that things aren't going right\nBut don't you think it deserves a fight?\nA love like ours don't happen every day\nAnd we're losing it (Losing it) right as we speak\nAnd if we don't wake up, it's a memory\nA time gone past, a love that sailed away\n\nAnd we're not making love no more\nWe're not even trying to change\n(We're not even trying to change)\nTell me how it slips away\n(Tell me how it slips away)\nDoes it ever stay the same?\nWe don't even talk no more\nWe've ran out of words to say\n(We're running out of words to say)\nTell me it don't have to change\n(No, it don't have to change)\nWon't it ever stay the same?\n\nI dream of lovers past and\nI see a girl so sad 'cause\nShe lost the only man she loved\nHe went away\nWell, it's not too late for us\nTo change\n\nBut we're not making love no more\n(We're not making love no)\nWe're not even trying to change\n(Not even trying to change)\nTell me how it slips away\n(Been trying to change, baby)\nDoes it ever stay the same?\nWe don't even talk no more\n(We don't even talk no more)\nWe've ran out of words to say\n(We used to be best friends)\nTell me it don't have to change\n(Don't even have to change, have to change)\nWon't it ever stay the same?\n(Dru Hill, let me sing it)\n\n(Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa) Said whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa\n(Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa) Said whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa\n(Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa) Hey hey\n(Does it ever stay the same?)\n(Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa) Sometimes, I get a little lonely\n(Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa) 'Cause I remember\n(Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa) You used to say to me, Sisqo\n(Won't it ever stay the same?) Yeah, yeah, yeah\n(We're not making love no more) I'm gonna be here for you\n(We're not even trying to change) I would wipe your tears for you\n(Tell me how it slips away) How did it slip away?\n(Does it ever stay the same?) Hey hey hey hey hey\n(We don't even talk no more) We don't even talk no more, no\n(We ran out of words to say) We ran out of words to say",
