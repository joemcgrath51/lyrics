 "lyrics": "Your face is beaming\nYou say it's 'cause you're dreaming\nOf how good it's going to be\nYou say you've been around\nAnd now you've finally found\nEverything you wanted and needed in me\n\nI don't have the heart to hurt you\nIt's the last thing I wanna do\nBut I don't have the heart to love you\nNot the way you want me to\n\nInside I'm dying\nTo see you crying\nHow can I make you understand\nI care about you\nSo much about you, baby\nI'm trying to say this as gently as I can\n\n'Cause I don't have the heart to hurt you\nIt's the last thing I wanna do\nBut I don't have the heart to love you\nNot the way you want me to\n\nYou're so trusting and open\nHoping that love will start\nBut I don't have the heart, oh no\nI don't have the heart\n\nI don't have the heart to hurt you\nIt's the last thing I wanna do\nBut I don't have the heart to love you\nNot the way that you want me to\n\n(I don't have the heart) Ooh\nBaby, I don't have the heart, I don't have the heart\n(I don't have the heart) Ooh, ooh\nBaby, I don't have\n(I don't have the heart)\n(I don't have the heart)\n(I don't have the heart)\n(I don't have the heart)",
