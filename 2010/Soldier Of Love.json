 "lyrics": "I've lost the use of my heart\nBut I'm still alive\nStill looking for the light\nAnd the endless pool on the other side\n\nIt's the wild wild west\nI'm doing my best\nI'm at the borderline of my faith\nI'm at the hinterland of my devotion\nI'm in the front line of this battle of mine\nBut I'm still alive\n\nI'm a soldier of love\nEvery day and night\nI'm a soldier of love\nAll the days of my life\n\nI've been torn up inside\nI've been left behind\nTall I ride\nI have the will to survive\nIn the wild, wild west\nTrying my hardest\nDoing my best to stay alive\n\nI am love's soldier\nI wait for the sound\nI know that love will come\nI know that love will come\nTurn it all around\n\nI'm a soldier of love\nEvery day and night\nI'm a soldier of love\nAll the days of my life\n\nI am lost but I don't doubt\nTall I ride\nI have the will to survive\nIn the wild, wild west\nTrying my hardest\nDoing my best to stay alive\n\nI am love's soldier\nI wait for the sound\nI know that love will come\nI know that love will come\nTurn it all around\n\nI'm a soldier of love\nI'm a soldier\nStill wait for love to come\nTurn it all around\nStill wait for love to come\nTurn it all around\nStill wait for love to come\nTurn it all around\nStill wait for love to come\nTurn it all around\nI'm a soldier of love\nI'm a soldier\nStill wait for love to come\nTurn it all around\nStill wait for love to come\nTurn it all around\nStill wait for love to come\nTurn it all around\nStill wait for love to come",
