Please don't\nTold her I'm goin' home, she asked can she go too\nI'm like, \"Yeah boo, I can't see me without you\"\nGot there, I took a shower, jumped out she in the bed\nWith a see-through thong set, I looked at her and said\n[Chorus: J-Weav & \nChingy\n]\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one call away (\nand you was my baby\n)\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\n(If you wanna roll, just)\nI'm only one call away (\nand you was my lady\n)\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one call away (\nand you was my baby\n)\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one love away (\nand you was my lady\n)\n\nGirl recognize game before game recognize you\nYou dealin with a playa, true, now what you wanna do\nWe can kick it and go puff on a blunt\nOh you don't smoke? Grab a pint of henn and we can get drunk\nIts up to you, I'm the man but baby just let me know\nCause if you got a attitude then I could treat you just like a ho\nIf ya rollin with me baby hop in its enough room\nWe can gaze at the stars and shine like the moon\nGive me a chance to show ya and a chance to know ya\nJust be true and theres nothing I won't do for ya\nSome women like to play it foul\nBut them the kind I put in a place of a child\nDon't worry be happy and smile\n[Chorus: J-Weav & \nChingy\n]\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one call away (\nand you was my baby\n)\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one call away (\nand you was my lady\n)\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one call away (\nand you was my baby\n)\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one love away (\nand you was my lady\n)\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one call away (\nand you was my baby\n)\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one call away (\nand you was my lady\n)\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one call away (\nand you was my baby\n)\nGive me a call if you wanna come roll with me\nI'm only one love away (\nand you was my lady\n)\n\nDTP, ha, how we do, ha, give me call, if you wanna ball, you know what it is",
