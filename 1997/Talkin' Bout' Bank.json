Fat lumps baby\nHook\nKing Saan:\nEverybody know it's all about bank\nPlayas ain't slippin' all day smokin' on dank\nGotta make sure I got security fuck the jury\nSo my fist of fury stay fired up\nEveryday posted drawn blue print with Mr. Tay\nSpend your scratch and let the hit play\nAnd potna you'll see why we called the WhoRidas\nSpittin' like choppers and snakes with venom\nMake you react like gin in your system\nLike adrenaline\nIf you're listenin'\nYou'll recognize that the lik is here uh\nFo life tightest new rhymes\nWhen we come through and life up your life\nLike ? flyin' through the night fool we strike\nYeah that's right\nCause when it really goes down\nFunk mode all through the town\nBitch you gots to stay paid till you go against the grain\nGot barrels to the brain\nJackers doin' they thang\nBallers in the game sellin' cocaine\nWomen yellin' your name with pictures in the frame\nI'm just talkin' bout bank\nHook",
