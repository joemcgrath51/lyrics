Big face hundreds\nJust left the mall, bought everythang that I wanted\nI kinda mad with you haters, I'm real disappointed\nCause what you didn't tell the people, is I got plenty money\nI got plenty money, I got plenty money\nI got plenty money, I got plenty money\nI got plenty money, I got plenty money\nI got plenty money, I got plenty money\n\nI like my bitches hood, but all my whips foreign\nJust bought another house, the last one was borin\nTen-thousand square-feet, it feel like you tourin\nYou niggas dissin me, it really ain't important\nTake off yo' shirt nigga, I bet yo' ribs showin\nYou niggas starvin, my money overflowin\nJewelry game sick; got all these hoes adorin'\nCatch me in the club with all the 'gnac pourin'\nIf I ever go to prison, I'mma have plenty stories\nSleep real good, cause I ain't got no worries\nStay fresh everyday, jewelry stay glowin\nI got plenty money and all you niggas knowin\n\nWhat's in my pocket dog? Big face hundreds\nJust left the mall, bought everythang that I wanted\nI kinda mad with you haters, I'm real disappointed\nCause what you didn't tell the people, is I got plenty money\n[I got plenty money, I got plenty money\nI got plenty money, I got plenty money\nI got plenty money, I got plenty money\nI got plenty money, I got plenty money\n\nNext month, guess what? I'm buyin rappers\nI'm startin to feel sorry for you lil' bastards\nI'm pretty hot, yo' career a disaster\nI control you niggas, somethin like yo master\n65 grand, that's 'round the bezel\nStay from 'round me if you don't like to smell cheddar\nI ain't fuckin with that ho cause she a dick hiker\nWanna know who I'm fuckin, my money, I just married her\nShe been good to me, I might five karat her\nRan me out the sto', I bought too many plasmas\nCount so much money, breathe like I got asthma\nThe old sayin is \"The mo' money, the merrier\"\n\nWhat's in my pocket dog? Big face hundreds\nJust left the mall, bought everythang that I wanted\nI kinda mad with you haters, I'm real disappointed\nCause what you didn't tell the people, is I got plenty money\n[I got plenty money, I got plenty money\nI got plenty money, I got plenty money\nI got plenty money, I got plenty money\nI got plenty money, I got plenty money\n\nI don't know why I bought the Bentley when I had the Maserati\nWhat I paid for the \"Goon\" chain, 140\nScared to keep money on me cause I will blow it\nMy strip club name is \"Mr. Will-Throw-It\"\nKeep fire on deck and I will show it\nFuck with me and get whacked and all you niggas know it\nScared to dance in the club cause my fire loaded\nIf you won't use it guess what? Then don't tote it\nMo' money to most niggas mean mo' hoeish\nMo' money to me it mean keep goin\nHaters gettin tired, my money still growin\nBall all night, catch a flight in the mo'nin",
