 "lyrics": "Alone in a room\nIt's just me and you\nI feel so lost\n'Cause I don't know what to do\nNow what if I choose the wrong thing to do\nI'm so afraid, afraid of disappointing you\n\nSo I need to talk to you\nAnd ask you for your guidance\nEspecially today\nWhen my life is so cloudy\nGuide me until I'm sure\nI open up my heart\nOh yeah\n\nMy hopes and dreams\nAre fading fast\nI'm all burned out\nAnd I don't think my strenghts gonna last\nSo I'm crying out\nCrying out to you\nLord I know that you're the only one\nWho is able to pull me through\n\nSo I need to talk to you\nAnd ask you for your guidance\nEspecially today\nWhen my life seems so cloudy\nLord guide me until I'm sure\nI open up my heart\n\nSo show me how\nTo do things your way\nDon't let me make the same mistakes\nOver and over again\nYour will be done\nAnd I'll be the one\nTo make sure that it's carried out\nAnd in me I don't want any doubt\nThat's why...\n\nI need to talk to you, yes I do\nAnd ask you for your guidance\nEspecially today\nWhen my life seems just a little bit cloudy\nLord you can guide me through\nThats why I open up\nI open up my heart, my heart\nMy heart, my heart\nAll I need to do is hear a single word from you\nI open up my heart\nJust one word could make a difference in what I do, Lord\n(Guide until I'm sure)\nI open my heart to you\nYou just say one word, one word, one word\nOne word, one word, one word\nI open up my heart to you\nYou're the lover of my soul\nCaptain of my sea\nI need a word from you\nThat's why I open up my heart",
