She's sittin' back in the room, the lights are off, she's cryin', and then my voice comes in, POW!, in the middle of the night, and this is what I told her for you\n\nEvery time I make a run\nGirl, you turn around and cry\nI ask myself why, oh why\nSee, you must understand, I can't work a 9 to 5\nSo I'll be gone 'til November\nSaid I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November\nYo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November\nI'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November\nYo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November\nJanuary, February, March, April, May\nI see you cryin', but girl, I can't stay\nI'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November\nAnd give a kiss to my mother\n\nWhen I come back, there'll be no need to clock\nI'll have enough money to buy out blocks\nTell my brother, \"Go to school in September\"\nSo he won't mess up in summer school in the summer\nTell my cousin, Jerry, wear his condom\nIf you don't wear condom, you'll see a red lump\nWoh oh oh oh\nYou sucker MC's, you got no flow\nI heard your style, you're s-o s-o\n\nEvery time I make a run\nGirl, you turn around and cry\nI ask myself why, oh why\nSee, you must understand, I can't work a 9 to 5\nSo I'll be gone 'til November\nSaid I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November\nYo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November\nI'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November\nYo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November\nJanuary, February, March, April, May\nI see you cryin', but girl, I can't stay\nI'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November\nAnd give a kiss to my mother\n\nI had to flip nuttin' and turn it into somethin'\nHip-hop turns to the future rock when I smash a pumpkin\nCommit treason, then I'll have a reason to hunt you down\nIt's only right, it's rappin' season\nYeah, you with the loud voice, posin' like you're top choice\nYour voice, I'll make a hearse out of your Rolls Royce\nBesides, I got my girl to remember\nAnd I'll commit it that I'll be back in November\n\nEvery time I make a run\nGirl, you turn around and cry\nI ask myself why, oh why\nSee, you must understand, I can't work a 9 to 5\nSo I'll be gone 'til November\nSaid I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November\nYo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November\nI'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November\nYo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November\nJanuary, February, March, April, May\nI see you cryin', but girl, I can't stay\nI'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November\nAnd give a kiss to my mother\n\nI know the hustle's hard, but we gotta enterprise, the carnival",
