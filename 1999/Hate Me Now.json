Let's go\n[\nBase Chorus: Puff Daddy]\nYou can hate me now.. but I won't stop now..\nCause\n I can't stop now.. you can hate me now..\nBut I won't stop now.. cause I can't stop now..\nYou can hate me now.. you can hate me NOWWWW..\n\nQ.B., real niggas, Bravehearts, c'mon\n\nWell you hate me I'm gon' hate you too\nIt's as simple as that\nDie motherfucker die motherfucker die\nYou don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck\nGo down any way you want it to go down (do it now)\nWeak, jealous motherfuckers (do it now, do it now)\nFuck y'all!\n\nDon't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy\nIce that I wear, clothes that I try, close your eyes\nPicture me rollin, sixes, money foldin\nBitches honies that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya\nMost critically acclaimed Pulitzer, prize winner\nBest storyteller thug narrator my style's greater\nModel dater, big threat to a lot of you haters\nCommentators ringside try watchin my paper\nAlmost a decade, quite impressive\nMost of the best is in the essence\nFor this rap shit that I stand for\nExpandin more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams\nBut it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens\nWant me off the scene fast, but good things last\nLike your favorite MC still makin some mean cash\nFirst rapper to bring a platinum plaque, back to the projects\nBut you still wanna hate",
