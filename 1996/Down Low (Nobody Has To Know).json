 "lyrics": "Listen, girl, you want me but he needs you\nYet you're telling me that everything is cool\nTrying to convince me, baby, to do as you say\nJust go along and see things your way\n\nAnd keep it on the down low\nNobody has to know\nWe can keep it on the down low\nNobody has to know\n\nSecret lovers is what you wanna be\nWhile making love to him, girl, you're silently calling on me\nWhat is a man to do in a situation like this?\nI feel there is something that I, I don't wanna miss\n\nAnd keep it on the down low\nNobody has to know\nWe can keep it on the down low\nNobody has to know\n\nBeautiful you are but you're his by far\nComing by my way driving his fancy car\nMaking plans to be in my life forever\nTell me, tell me that we'll always be together\n\nAnd keep it on the down low\nNobody has to know\nWe can keep it on the down low\nNobody has to know\n\nListen, babe, I won't whisper a word\nHow could you go, so low, so low\nNobody, nobody, nobody\nKeep it on the down low",
