Okay, okay!\nUsher (Usher, Usher, Usher, Usher)\nLil Jon\nLet's go!\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!\nLet's go!\n\nI was up in the club with my homies, trying to get a lil V-I\nKeep it down on the low key (Low key)\nYou should know how it feels (Hey!)\nI seen shorty, she was checkin' up on me\nFrom the game, she was spitting in my ear\nYou would think that she know me (Know me)\nI decided to chill (Okay!)\nConversation got heavy (Hey!)\nShe had me feeling like she's ready to blow (Watch out!)\nOhh! (Watch out)\nShe's saying, come get me (Come get me)\nSo I got up and followed her to the floor\nShe said, \"baby, let's go\"\nWhen I told her (Let's go!), I said\n\n(Yeah!) Yeah!\nShorty got down low, she said, \"come and get me\"\n(Yeah!) Yeah!\nI got so caught up, I forgot she told me\n(Yeah!) Yeah!\nHer and my girl, they used to be the best of homies\n(Yeah!) Yeah!\nNext thing I knew, she was all up on me, screaming\nYeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!\nYeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!\n\nSo she's all up in my head now, got me thinking\nThat it might be a good idea to take her with me\n'Cause she's ready to leave (Ready to leave now) (Let's go!)\nAnd I got to keep it real now\n'Cause on a one to ten, she's a certified twenty\nBut that just ain't me (Hey!)\n'Cause I don't know, if I take that chance\nJust where's it gonna lead?\nBut what I do know is the way she dance\nMake shorty alright with me\nThe way she get low\nI'm like, yeah, just work that out for me\nShe asks for one more dance, and I'm like, yeah\nHow the hell am I supposed to leave?\n(Let's go, bring the beat back!) And I say\n\n(Yeah!) Yeah!\nShorty got down low, she said, \"come and get me\"\n(Yeah!) Yeah!\nI got so caught up, I forgot she told me\n(Yeah!)

Yeah!\nNext thing I knew, she was all up on me, screaming\nYeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!\nYeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!\n(Hey! Hey! Luda!)\n\nWatch out, my outfit's ridiculous\nIn the club looking so conspicuous\nAnd roar, these women all on the prowl\nIf you hold the head steady, I'ma milk the cow (Yeah!)\nAnd forget about game, I'ma spit the truth (What?)\nI won't stop 'til I get 'em in their birthday suit (Yeah!)\nSo gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes\nThen bend over to the front, and touch your toes\nI left the Jag and I took the Rolls\nIf they ain't cutting, then I put 'em on foot patrol (Let's go!)\nHow you like me now?\nWhen my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand\nLet's drink, you the one to please (Yeah!)\nLudacris fill cups like double D's (Yeah!)\nMe and Ursh' once more, and we leaves 'em dead\nWe want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed, that say\n\n(Yeah!) Yeah!\nShorty got down low, she said, \"come and get me\"\n(Yeah!) Yeah!\nI got so caught up, I forgot she told me\n(Yeah!) Yeah!\nHer and my girl, they used to be the best of homies\n(Yeah!) Yeah!\nNext thing I knew, she was all up on me, screaming\nYeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!\nYeah (Yeah!) yeah (Yeah!) yeah, yeah!\n\nTake that and rewind it back\nLil Jon got the beat that make your booty go (Clap)\nTake that, rewind it back\nUrsher got the voice make your booty go (Clap)\nTake that, rewind it back\nLudacris got the flow to make your booty go (Clap)\nTake that, rewind it back\nLil Jon got the beat that make your booty go (Clap)",
