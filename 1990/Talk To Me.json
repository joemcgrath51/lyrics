Ain't no reason)\nWhy don't you tell me what you're going through?\n(Ain't no reason in the world for you to do this, baby)\nWhat's wrong, wrong with you?\n(Not like this, ain't no reason)\nWhy don't you tell me what you're going through?\n(Ain't no reason, reason in the world)\nWhat's wrong, wrong with you?\nWhy don't you tell me what you're going through?",
