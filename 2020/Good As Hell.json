(Feelin' good as hell)\n\nWoo, child, tired of the bullshit\nGo on, dust your shoulders off, keep it moving\nYes, Lord, tryna get some new shit\nIn there, swimwear, going-to-the-pool shit\nCome now, come dry your eyes\nYou know you a star, you can touch the sky\nI know that it's hard, but you have to try\nIf you need advice, let me simplify\n\nIf he don't love you anymore\nJust walk your fine ass out the door\n\nI do my hair toss, check my nails\nBaby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)\nHair toss, check my nails\nBaby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)\n(Feeling good as hell)\nBaby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)\n\nWoo, girl, need to kick off your shoes\nGotta take a deep breath, time to focus on you\nAll the big fights, long nights that you been through\nI got a bottle of tequila I been saving for you\nBoss up and change your life\nYou can have it all, no sacrifice\nI know he did you wrong, we can make it right\nSo go and let it all hang out tonight\n\n'Cause he don't love you anymore\nSo walk your fine ass out the door\n\nAnd do your hair toss, check my nails\nBaby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)\nHair toss, check my nails\nBaby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell) (Show it off tonight)\nHair toss, check my nails\nBaby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell) (And we gon' be alright)\nHair toss, check my nails\nBaby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)\n\nMmm, yeah, alright\nListen, if he don't love you anymore\nThen walk your fine ass out the door\n\nAnd do your hair toss, check my nails\nBaby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell) (Woo-hoo)\nHair toss, check my nails\nBaby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell) (Show it off tonight)\nHair toss, check my nails\nBaby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell) (And we gon' make it right)\nHair toss, check my nails\nBaby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)\n(Feelin' good as hell)\nBaby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)",
