 "lyrics": "I wish that I could stay\nBut stayin' here confuses me more, so I'll go\n'Cause there's someone else who cares for me like you do\nYou are my friend, and I don't wanna cross the line\nIt's so easy to make you mine\nI keep pushin' you away\n'Cause you give me what I miss at home\nI'm goin' through changes\nAnd how do I let you go?\nMy mind is goin' through changes, goin' through some changes, yeah\nAnd I can't let him go\nPlease don't touch me there\nTemptation wants to rule me\nI can't do what my body is callin' out for\nI'm so confused\nYou know what I like, and you wanna give me all of you\nAnd I think about it, too\nBut I keep goin' through these changes\n'Cause there's so much that I miss at home\nI'm goin' through changes\nHow do I let you go? I gotta get it together, ooh, ooh, ooh\nMy mind is goin' through changes\nAnd I can't let him go\nI know what you want, I know what you want\nEverything' about us will change, it's gonna change\nEverything I feel says stay here with you\nI wanna stay here with you\nI don't really know what to do\nI don't know what to do\nI can't get nothin' at home, nothin'\nThe more I think about it, I'm so confused, so confused\nI'm goin' through some changes\nI'm goin' through changes, and how do I let you go?\nMy mind is goin' through changes, some changes\nAnd I can't let him go\nI'm goin' through changes, don't know what to do, don't know what\nHow do I let you go?\nMy mind is goin' through changes, goin' through some changes\nAnd I can't let him go\nI'm goin' through changes, goin' through some changes\nHow do I let you go?\nMy mind is goin' through changes\nAnd I can't let him go\nI'm goin' through changes",
