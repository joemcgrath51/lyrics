(I'll be here)\nCause, my whole has been full of joy every since\nYou came here...Girl\n\nMy whole world goes around\nBecause you spin me yeah (spin me)\nAnd every time we're done making love girl\nYou makes me wanna\n\nSome believes in love\nAnd some people don't\nSimilar to a story, when it's told\nA thousand years from now\nWe'll be still puttin' down my baby\nSome have cross the finish line and some gave up\nIt's like moving a mountain\nLove can be just that tough yeah\n(A thousand years from now)\n(We'll be still putting it down, my baby)\nBaby girl in other words for ever more\nI'll be here. (I'll be here.)\nCause my whole has been full of joy since\nYou came here...Girl\n\nMy whole world goes around\nBecause you spin me yeah (spin me)\nAnd every time we're done making love girl\nYou makes me wanna\n\nNow we gonna play a little game\nAnd this game is for all of those who\nKnow how to follow the rules of this game.
