Illegally going 120\nEasy weavin' in and out of the traffic\nThey cannot catch me, I'm smashin'\nI'm duckin', buckin' them out here\nI'm lookin' fuckin' fantastic, I am up in a classic\nNow I know what it's like under the city lights\nRidin' into the night, drivin' over the bridge\nThe same one we'd walk across as kids\nKnew I'd have a whip but never one like this\nOld school, old school\nCandy paint, two-seater\nYeah, I'm from Seattle, there's hella Honda Civics\nI couldn't tell you about paint either\nBut I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours\nAnd rolled on over to the dealer\nAnd I found the car I dreamed of, placed a bargain with this geezer\nGot the keys in, as I was leavin' I started screamin'\n\nI got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive\nGot that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time\nI'm rolling that roof off, letting in sky\nI shine, the city never looked so bright\n\nYeah, uh\nBackwoods and dope\nWhite hoes in the backseat snortin' coke\nShe doing line after line like she's writing rhymes\nI had her inhalin' my love, tryna blow her mind\nCadillac pimpin', my uncle was on\n14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone\nStealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron\nDrivin', smilin' like I won the fucking lottery homes\n(Fuckin' lottery homes)\nTires with the spokes on it, and the Vogues too\nMustard and mayonnaise, keepin' the buns all on\nMy dogs hangin' out the window\nYoung as whoosh, fuckin' like we ball\nTryna fuck 'em all\nNever park the whip, see what's poppin' at the mall\nMeet a bad bitch, slap her booty with my paw\nYou can smoke the pussy, I was tearin' down the walls\nI'm motherfuckin' awe-\n-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize\nGrip the leather steerin' wheel while I grip the thighs\nSee the lust stuck up in her eyes\nMaybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?\nOr does she want it low?\n'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you'll never know\nSo we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit\nGot a window tinted, for sure a gangsta in it\nSlide 'til the gas is finished\nQ\n\nOff-black Cadillac, midnight drive\nGot that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time\nI'm rolling that roof off, letting in sky\nI shine, the city never looked so bright\nGot that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive\nGot that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time\nI'm rolling that roof off, letting in sky\nI shine, the city never looked so, looked so bright",
