 "lyrics": "Walking around looking for a way\nBut no one tells me which way to go\nI'm caught up in a world\nA Labyrinth, a maze\nWhere yes men could easily be known\nI ask them no questions\nThey give me no answers\nFollowing the wise\nBut they're walking in pampers\nGive me a cigarette\nSmoking my cancer\nDrink the pain away\nBut I still have no answers\n\nI'm lost on a road\nDon't know which way to go\nI'm losing my mind\nLosing control of the wheel\nAnd I'm swerving\nOn and off the road\nI'm lost on a road\nBut survival is a must\nDon't know who I can trust\nI'm livin in a rush\nI don't understand this fuss\nMy brain is bout to bust\n\nI think I'm losin it\nI might be losin it\nI just might lose\nAm I losin my mind?\nAnd I'm so confused I don't know what to do\nAnd I need a clue before I run out of time\nAm I losin it?\nAm I losin it?\nI think I'm losin\nI'm losin my mind\nAm I losin it?\nAm I losin it?\nI think I'm losin\nI'm losin my mind\n\nI call up my girlfriend she dosen't answer\nI hit the strip club and fuck with a dancer\nThrowing my ones up, like I'm paying ransom\nTold me I look good, she said I was handsome\nSo believed her, because I am lonely\nIm just a loner, my life is a movie\nTonight we're just actors, and this is a sitcom\nSo tell me you love me, and tell me i'll get some\n\n\nI'm makin this money\nJust to go spend it\nLivin the good life\nHope nobody ends it\nBut who are you kidding?\nAy who are you lying to?\nYou know if they want you\nBest believe they will find you",
