 "lyrics": "Sometimes I feel so alone\nI call your heart, but there's no one at home\nTaking a toll on my pride, pride\nI'm reaching out, but there's no one inside\n\nYou know it doesn't feel right\nWhen I look in your eyes\nI know love is blind, but the heart doesn't lie\nI'll ask one more time, maybe this time you'll try\nSo tell me girl, what's deep in your heart\n\nGirl, I care about you\nI'm there for you\nSo why don't you care for me like I care about you?\nGirl, I care about you\nI'm there for you\nSo why don't you care for me like I care about you?\n\nI spend like all of my days, baby\nTrying to suss out just how things got this way\nI thought that we were in love\nBut I swear right now, I don't know what you want\n\nI make sure that I give you quality time\nBut lately I feel you're not home by design\nBut still I'm gon' try to give you the love of my life\nIn hopes that you, that you will open up your heart\n\nGirl, I care about you\nI'm there for you\nSo why don't you care for me like I care about you?\nGirl, I care about you\nI'm there for you\nSo why don't you care for me like I care about you?\n\nSometimes (sometimes I'm not) I'm not sure that\n(I'm all you've got) That I'm all you've got\n(Sometimes I'm not) Sometimes I'm not sure if you love me or not, baby\nJust one thing that I'm certain of\nGirl I care for you\nAnd the one thing that I want is that you care for me too\n\nGirl, I care about you\nI'm there for you\nSo why don't you care for me like I care about you?\nGirl, I care about you\nI'm there for you\nSo why don't you care for me like I care about you?\nGirl, I care about you\nI'm there for you\nSo why don't you care for me like I care about you?\nGirl, I care about you\nI'm there for you\nSo why don't you care for me like I care about you?",
