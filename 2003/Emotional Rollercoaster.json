 "lyrics": "Last night, I cried, tossed and turned\nWoke up with dry eyes\nMy mind was racing\nFeet were pacing\nLord, help me please\nTell me what I have gotten into\nRan my three miles to clear my mind\nIt always helps me out\nIt's my therapy\nWhen I'm losing it which is usually\n\nI'm on a emotional rollercoaster\nLoving you ain't nothing healthy\nLoving you was never good for me\nBut I can't get off\nIt's emotional rollercoaster\nLoving you ain't nothing healthy\nLoving you was never good for me (for me)\nBut I can't get off\n\nYesterday, I told myself\nI was gonna be okay\nGonna start a new day\nBe truly happy\nI was gonna take control of me\nBut eventually reality hit me\nMentally, physically, emotionally\nAnd I opened my eyes and realized\nThat I was still being\nTaken for a constant ride on your\n\n\nSo tired of you making love to me\nThen disappearing so suddenly\nUp and down it goes\nAnd I'm so tired of you pacifying me\nWith promises you know\nThat you'll never keep\nRound and round it goes",
