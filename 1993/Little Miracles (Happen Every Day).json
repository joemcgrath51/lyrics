 "lyrics": "One thing I would love to do\nIs talk to someone\nWish I knew who\nSometimes the people who know the least say the most\nMakes you wonder who you can trust\nWhat's gonna happen\nThe first thing I know\nGod is love\nThe next thing would be\nHe loves me\nSometimes I'm tired of waiting for a thing or someone\nThen I stop and see what He's done\nAnd I know everything will come\n\nAnd it may be today\nAnything can change, nothing stays the same\nAnd maybe today\nWhat's tomorrow for?\nNo one knows for sure\nThrough it all come what may\nLittle miracles happen every day\n\nAnd so there you go\nStrangely enough\nAlone even so\nAddicted to love\nYou're in and out so quickly\nThat it gives you a start\nYou're waiting for a message or a word\nBut you haven't heard from your heart\n\nBut it may be today\nAnything can change\nNothing stays the same\nAnd maybe today\nFor the love in me\nI really believe\nThrough it all come what may\nLittle miracles happen every day\n\nWhat is a miracle?\nLove is a miracle\nEvery time that you care\nA miracle, it happens somewhere\nSo many miracles\nEven small little miracles\nJust take one look about\nIt's not hard to figure out\n\n'Cause it might be today\nAnything can change\nNothing stays the same\nAnd maybe today\nWhat tomorrow's for\nNo one knows for sure\nThrough it all come what may\nLittle miracles happen everyday\nLittle miracles happen every day\nOoh, little miracles happen every day\nThey happen every day",
