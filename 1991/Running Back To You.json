 "lyrics": "Let's go\nBreak!\nBoy, you've been running around too long\nAnd I think that you're running out of time\nNo more jumping in and out of bed\nIt's time for me to draw the line\nSo you think that you can call me the only one\nThen walk out the door\nAnd you think that you can run around having fun\nAnd come back for more\nI think that you're living in a fantasy\nIt's gotta be them or me\nSo if you try it one more time\nBaby, don't expect me to come running back\nRunning back to you\nThen you'll think about love, all the good love I gave to you\nI won't come running, running back to you\nAnd I'll find someone, somebody else to give it to\nOh, oh.  Oh, oh\nI won't come running back, I won't come running\nOh, oh.  Oh, oh\nI won't come running back, I won't come running\nBoy, hope you see before too late\nI won't play the fool, no, not this time\nI'll show you just how wrong you are\nTo think I just can't get you off my mind\nSo you think that you can call me the only one\nThen walk out the door\nAnd you think that you can run around having fun\nAnd come back for more\nI think that you're living in a fantasy\nIt's gotta be them or me\nAnd if you diss me once more\nBaby, don't expect me to come running back\nRunning back to you\nThen you'll think about love, all the good love I gave to you\nI won't come running, running back to you\nAnd I'll find someone, somebody else to give it to\nOh, oh.  Oh, oh\nI won't come running back, I won't come running\nOh, oh.  Oh, oh\nI won't come running back, I won't come running\nYou can't just diss me when you wanna\n(Diss me when you wanna)\nOr come and go when you wanna\n(Come and go when you wanna)\nI hear you're playing around when you wanna\n(Around when you wanna)\nAnytime that you wanna\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOr just tell me lies when you wanna\n(Tell me lies when you wanna.)\nI got more than you wanna.  (More than you wanna)\nOh, and by the way, this one's for you\nI won't come running back, I won't come running, no\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nI won't come running back, no.  I won't come running\n(Oh, oh.) Running, running, running, running\nRunning, running, running\nI won't come running, running back to you\nThen you'll think about love, all the good love I gave to you\nI won't come running, running back to you\nAnd I'll find someone, somebody else to give it to\nOh, no.  I won't come running back, I won't come running\nNo, oh no.  I won't come running back, I won't come running\nRunning back to you.  No, no, no\nGet the message?  Enough said",
