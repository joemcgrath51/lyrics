 "lyrics": "I'm in luv\nRound and round I go\nOut of control, I'm in luv\nI'm in luv\nRound and round I go\nOut of control, I'm in luv\nNow from the very start\nYou knew you had my heart\nIt was plain to see\nOoo, good god almighty\nThe way you work that body\nIt was something to remember\nAnd I dance all in this\nImagine you and me\nA gentle summer breeze\nWhat a lovely affair\nChampagne and candlelights\nRomance and moonlights\nGirl, I'm no beginner so I hope you're no pretender\nI can't deny\nGirl, you turn me on\nMake me lose my self-control\nWhen you hold me close\nI'm in luv\nCrazy love\nGirl, I must admit it\nI am so addicted to your love\nWhat I like\nGirl, you've got it\nWhat I need\nYou give it to me\nWhat I want\nIs your sweet loving, baby",
