A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody\nI got a little drink but it's not Bacardi\nIf you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry\nI gotta give it to her like we in a marriage\nOh, like we in a hurry\nNo, no, I won't tell nobody\nYou're on your level too\nTryna do what lovers do\n\nFeelin' like I'm fresh out; Boosie (Boosie)\nIf they want the drama, got the Uzi (Uzi)\nShip the whole crew to the cruise ship (Cruise)\nDoin' shit you don't even see in movies (Movies)\nRide with me, ride with me, boss (Boss)\nI got a hard head, but her ass soft (Soft)\nShe want the last name with the ring on it\n'Cause I pulled out a million cash, told her plank on it\n[Refrain: Swae Lee & \nFrench Montana\n]\nAnd you are unforgettable\nI need to get you alone\nNow you wanna choose\nJust pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi\n\nIt's not good enough for me\nSince I've been with you, ooh\nI'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up\nI should know how to pick up\nI'm gonna catch the rhythm\nWhile she push up against me, ooh, and she tipsy\nI had enough convo for 24\nI peep'd you from across the room\nPretty little body dancin' like GoGo, hey\nAnd you are unforgettable\nI need to get you alone (Oeh)\nWhy not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody\nI got a little drink but it's not Bacardi\nIf you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry\nI gotta give it to her like we in a marriage\nOh, like we in a hurry\nNo, no, I won't tell nobody\nYou're on your level too\nTryna do what lovers do\n\nYou ain't enough for me\nToo much for you alone\nBaby, go and grab some bad bitches, bring 'em home\nKnow the jet's on me\nI'ma curve my best for you, you know\nSo pick up that dress for me\nLeave the rest on\nToo much convo for 24 hours\nWhen you stand next to 24 karats\nShe left her man at home\nShe don't love him no more\nI want your mind and your body\nDon't mind nobody\nSo, you don't ever hurt nobody\nBaby girl, work your body, work your body\n[Refrain: Swae Lee & \nFrench Montana\n]\nAnd you are unforgettable\nI need to get you alone\nNow you wanna choose\nJust pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi\nWhy not?\n\nOh, like we in a hurry\nNo, no, I won't tell nobody\nYou're on your level too\nTryna do what lovers do",
