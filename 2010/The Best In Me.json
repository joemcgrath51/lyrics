One more time?\nI said he saw the best in me\nWhen everyone else around me\nCould only see the worst in me\nI wish I had a witness tonight, all I need is one\nHe saw the best in me\nWhen everyone else around me\nCould only see the worst in me\nDoes anybody have their testimony?\nWhen folks wrote you off\nSaid you would never make it\nWhat did he see?\nHe saw the best in me\nWhen everyone else around me\nWhen everyone else around could only see the worst in me\nCan I tell you all one more thing?\nI just need to tell you one more thing, listen to this\nSee, he's mine, and I am his\nIt doesn't matter what I did\nHe only sees me for who I am\nDoes anyone know that tonight?\nSee he is mine, and I am his\nSaid it doesn't matter what I did\nSee, he only sees me for who I am\nHelp me sing it\nSaid he is mine\n(He is mine)\nSaid it doesn't matter what I did\nHe only sees me for who I am\nHe is mine, I am his\nIt doesn't matter what I did\nHe only sees me for who I am\nI am so glad that he is mine\nIt doesn't matter what I did\nHe only sees me for whom I am\nHe saw the best in me\nWhen everyone else around\nCould only see the worst in me\nI wish I had a witness tonight\nCan I ask ya'll one question?\nThe question is simply this\nWhat did he see?\n(He saw the best)\nI can't get no help up in here\nBecause there's some folk in here that people have wrote you off\nSaid you would never amount to anything\nSaid that you would never end up being anywhere\nBut Myron, tell 'em one more time, what did he see?\nHe saw the best\nWhen momma said you would never be nothin'\nWhen aunties and uncles said you would never amount to anything\nWhen daddy didn't come home anymore\nHe didn't look at you and say that you weren't going to make it\nGod looked at you and what did he see, what did he see?\nHe saw the best, the best\nWhat did he see?\n(The best)\nI said, what did he see?\n(The best)\nI said, what did he see?\n(The best)\nI said, what did he see?\n(The best)\nI said, what did he see?\n(The best)\nI said, what did he see?\n(The best)\nHe saw the best in me",
