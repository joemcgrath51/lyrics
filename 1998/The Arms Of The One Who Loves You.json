 "lyrics": "I know you're going\nI can't make you stay\nI can only let you know I love you any way\nAnd if the road you take leads to heartbreak\nSomewhere down the line\nIf someone ever hurts you\nOr treats your heart unkind\n\nYou just run to the arms of the one who loves you\nYou just run to these arms\nAnd these two arms will keep you warm\nWhen rain has found your heart\nNever fear, I'm never far\nYou just run to the arms of the one who loves you\n\nI want you happy\nI want the best for you\nAnd if you have to leave to find your dream\nI hope that dream comes true\nBut if the world you find brings you hard times\nIf someone makes you cry\nI'll be there to hold you\nI'll be standing by\n\n\nMy love is strong enough, you know\nStrong enough to let you go\nBut I'll always hold you\nInside my heart\n(And if you should ever change your mind\nYou can come back any time)\nAnd when you do (and when you do)",
