 "lyrics": "Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh\n\nI'm always ready for a war again\nGo down that road again\nIt's all the same\nI'm always ready to take a life again\nYou know I'll ride again\nIt's all the same (Ooh, ooh, ooh)\nTell me who's gon' save me from myself\nWhen this life is all I know\nTell me who's gon' save me from this hell\nWithout you, I'm all alone\n\nWho gon' pray for me?\nTake my pain for me?\nSave my soul for me?\n'Cause I'm alone, you see\nIf I'm gon' die for you\nIf I'm gon' kill for you\nThen I spilled this blood for you, hey\n\nI fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself\nI fight God, just tell me how many burdens left\nI fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept\nI'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps\nLife a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets\nShooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief\nEarthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks\nThe poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface\nWho need a hero? (Hero)\nYou need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero\nWho on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)\nMy heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle\nMass destruction and mass corruption\nThe souls of sufferin' men\nClutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'\nIt's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good\nThen that's what it gotta be\n\nWho gon' pray for me?\nTake my pain for me?\nSave my soul for me?\n'Cause I'm alone, you see\nIf I'm gon' die for you\nIf I'm gon' kill for you\nThen I spilled this blood for you, hey\n\nHey, hey, hey, hey\nHey, hey, hey, hey\n\nWho gon' pray for me?\nTake my pain for me?\nSave my soul for me?\n'Cause I'm alone, you see\nIf I'm gon' die for you\nIf I'm gon' kill for you\nThen I spilled this blood for you, hey\n\nJust in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law\nI'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own\nJust in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law\nI'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own",
