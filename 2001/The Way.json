 "lyrics": "Woke up this morning with a smile on my face\nJumped out of bed, took a shower, dressed, cleaned up my place\nMade me some breakfast - toast, two scrambled eggs, grits\nGrabbed my keys, grabbed my purse, grabbed my jacket\nOff to work beaming all the way down 3rd\n\nIs it the way you love me baby?\nIs it the way you love me baby? (Yeah)\n\n4:30, can't wait to get home\n(I know you're comin' out with us)\nNah, girl, I got something else to do\n(Damn Jill, don't be frontin' on your girls for real)\nGo ahead, really get your groove on\n'Cause tonight my man's coming through (Oh word?) yeah\nWe gonna have to connect some other time\n(It's cool, I understand)\nAs much as I like to shake my thing on the dance floor\nI got another nasty, freaky, just-right way in mind\nTonight I'm gonna beat the high score\n\nIs it the way you love me baby? (Yeah)\nIs it the way you love me baby? (Baby)\nIs it the way you love me baby? (Is it, is it the way)\nIs it the way you love me baby?",
