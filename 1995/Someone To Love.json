 "lyrics": "Don't even like to think about it\nI don't know what I would do without it\nI only know I live and breathe for your love\nBaby you came to me in my time of need\nWhen I needed you, you're there for me\nBaby, the love from you is what got me through\nIt's because of you I was able to\nGive my heart again, you give me\n\nSomeone to love\nSomeone to touch\nSomeone to hold\nSomeone to know\nSomeone to love\nSomeone to trust\nSomeone to hold\nOh someone to know\n\nI thought I'd never love again\nI thought my life was over and\nI didn't want to face nor even see another day\nSuddenly from nowhere, baby you appeared\nYou dried my tears, you cared for me\nBaby your love for me, truly rescued me\nIt's because of you, I was able to\nFall in love again, you give me\n\nSomeone to love\nSomeone to touch\nSomeone to hold\nSomeone to know\nSomeone to love\nSomeone to trust\nSomeone to hold\nOh someone to know\n\nFor so long in my life, I wouldn't let love inside\nBut I swallowed my pride the day you arrived\nNow that you're by my side\nEverything is all right\nIt's because of you, I was able to\nGive my heart again, you give me\n\nSomeone to love\nSomeone to touch\nSomeone to hold\nSomeone to know\nSomeone to love\nSomeone to trust\nSomeone to hold\nOh someone to know\nSomeone to love\nSomeone to touch\nSomeone to hold\nSomeone to know\nSomeone to love\nSomeone to trust\nSomeone to hold\nOh someone to know",
