 "lyrics": "See, most of my life I never had shit\nI felt like an outcast, treated like a misfit\nDamn near didn't make it on my day of birth\nThinking, \"Was I really supposed to be on this planet earth?\"\nI take a deep breath and then another follows\n'Cause hard shit is kinda hard to swallow\nSee, it's rough being a loner\nNot knowing any given day and time I could wind up a goner\nSee, people got it bad from jump-street\nAnd being short is just another strike against me\nI used to get funny looks 'cause I was small\nAnd trying to make it was like running through a brick wall\nGiven the odds I was up against, bro\nThe average nigga would've quit a long time ago\nBut now I've got a record out\nI'm doing shows, people paying to see me turn it out\nNow, I'm the spice around town\nIt's funny how an album can change a nigga's life around\nI got friends and bitches on my dick\nBut when they look at Richard all they see is Bushwick\nSometimes I don't know a friend from a foe\nAnd every different day it's a different fuckin' ho\nAnd now that my pockets are getting bigger\nI'm meeting hoes who only wanna juice a nigga\nThey tell me that they love me and all that\nBut really they just wait for me to fall flat\nSo they can get me for my income\nTake me for all I got, and then some\nLike Trina, you dig?\nI fucked up and got too attached to the bitch's kid\nKnowing that she used the baby to use me\nTook him out my life, mentally abusing me\nBut as the time went by, I got another slimmy\nAnd she was just like the first one screaming, \"Gimme\"\nBut not in the exact same way\nShe had a different type of game she liked to play\nHer name was Crystal, she played the quiet type\nAnd for a little while, shit seemed alright\nBut just like the first ho, homie\nWhen shit got hectic, the bitch broke out on me\nAnd it's getting out of hand, G\n'Cause nobody seems to understand me\nReminiscing got me feeling kinda low\nI broke out the Everclear and then I drunk some mo'\nUntil it was all gone\nNow I'm looking for somebody to take my pain out on\nBut not just anybody, G\nI'ma take that on Tamica, 'cause she's the closest to me\nFull of that Everclear and high on that buddah\nGet to the house, all I'm thinking 'bout is shooting her\n'Cause shooting her would be sweet\nBut you know what'd be sweeter? If I make her shoot me\nCall me crazy, but that's what I'm thinking\nI'm tripping, from all that smoking weed and drinking\nBut I knew she wouldn't do it on her own, so I provoked her\nPunched her, kicked her, and chocked her\nShe still wouldn't grab the gun\nAnd at that time, I wasn't thinking about no one\nDamn near crazy, I went and grabbed the baby\n(Bill! Gimme the baby! Gimme the baby!)\nHeld him by the door and said I'ma throw his ass out, ho\nShe went to crying, \"Somebody stop him\"\nI said, \"You better grab the motherfuckin' gun or I'mma drop him\"\nShe snatched the baby out of my hands\nWe started fighting, punching, scratching, and biting\nWhen we fell on the bed, check this shit\nAll kinds of crazy shit was going through my head\nSo I ran and got the gun and came back to her\nLoaded it up and handed the gat to her\nI grabbed her hand and placed the gun to my eye muscle\nShe screamed, \"Stop,\" and then we broke into another tussle\nYo, during the fight the gun went off quick\nDamn\u2014Ah shit, I'm hit\n\n(Oh, Lord! Oh, Bill!)\nAhh... my eye, I can't see\n(Oh, I'm so sorry!)\nWhy you shot me in the eye?\n(Oh my God, somebody help me!)\nI would've shot you in the body\n(Oh, I'm sorry!)\nWhy you shot me in the eye?\n\nRiding in the ambulance, everything is hectic\nI can't get a grip, I just can't check this\nEverybody's crying, could it be I'm dying?\nBullet in my head, in the bed I was lying\nWhere's 'Mica? I wanna tell her I love her\nWith an IV in my arm, I took a picture for an album cover\nGoddamn, this shit's a trip, G\nFive different doctors with needles tryna stick me\nI hear my family hollering, \"He needs us!\"\nDuring the confusion, man, I seen Jesus\nMy mom's on the phone, long-distance, from New York\nHere comes the doctors again, trying to rip me apart\nI got a monkey on my back, I can't shake this\nI'm having suicidal thoughts, hoping that I don't make it\nBut I'ma make it, 'cause something's steady urging me\nFive hours passed, I made it through surgery\nAnd the doctor said I wouldn't make it through the night\nBut God told me, \"Everything is gonna be alright\"\nAnd I'm glad that I'm here, G\nBut it's fucked up I had to lose an eye to see shit clearly",
