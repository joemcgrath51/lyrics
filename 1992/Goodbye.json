 "lyrics": "Say, lady\nCan I ask you why you\u2019re treating me\nLlike a step child\nWith a future not so bright\nI thought you said\nYou would never be that way to me\nYou said you'd never leave me\nFor the rest of my life\nI believe you\nAll the times you said\nBaby, you\u2019re always on my mind\nI don't believe you\nSo save those words you said to me\nAnd I'll be on my way\nI've got to say\nGoodbye, baby\n\nYou didn't want my love\nThat's what starts the pain, baby\nYou didn't need my love\nI think that's your game\n\nGoodbye, goodbye\nYou'd never be that way to me\nGoodbye, goodbye, goodbye\nI've got a love\nThat you will never see\nHey\n\nI guess you thought you had me\nStrung out on your love\nSimply because you're oh, so fine\nIt takes more than looks\nTo steal my heart away from me\nSo I'm sorry, baby\nThe joke's on you this time\n\n\n\nI'm on a rampage\nThis is my stage\n'Cause I'm the T to the E to the V to the I to the N\nThat's where it starts\nHere we go\n\nGoodbye\nGoodbye",
