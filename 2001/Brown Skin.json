(Down)\nBeautiful mahogany\nYou make me feel like a queen (You make me feel like a queen)\nTell me what's that thing you do\nThat makes me wanna get next to you, yeah (Yeah)\nOh, oh, I want your\n\nBrown skin, you know I love your brown skin (Brown skin)\nI can't tell where yours begins\nI can't tell where mine ends\nBrown skin (Ooh), up against my brown skin (Brown skin)\nNeed some every now and then (Need some every now and then, hey)\nBrown skin (Ooh), you know I love your brown skin (Brown skin)\nI can't tell where yours begins\nI can't tell where mine ends (Hey)\nBrown skin (You know), up against my brown skin (Brown skin)\nNeed some every now and then (Oh, yeah, oh)\n\nOh, oh\nHey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey\nOh, oh, oh, ooh\nOh, oh, oh, hey",
