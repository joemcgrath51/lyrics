 "lyrics": "Telling me what you gon' do\nPointless cause you don't come through\nWasted breathe and words on you\nI've done all i can do\nIt's true one time i let you under my skin\nBut you overstayed your welcome na na na nana\nPlanned the tricks you scandalized\nYou make your moves you try to hide\nCause i began to realize all of your seldom ways\nIt's true i've made up my mind\nYour wrong for me by your side\nThe love i know but you'll never find\nThat i'm not in your picture\nLet go baby\nGotta let it go\nDon't you let it slow your roll\nHold on to the words ( i gotta )\nLet go baby\nDon't you cry no more\nFor you remain in control\nBaby let go\nLet go ( shine shine )\nLet go\nSo to keep it real and true\nI'ma do what i'ma do\nBest do the same thing too\n(right now it's time to move on)\nI can't get used to being a pawn in your love game\nYou won't have me again na na na nana\nLet go baby\nGotta let it go\nDon't you let it slow your roll\nHold on to the words ( baby baby )\nLet go baby\nDon't you cry no more\nFor you remain in control\nBaby let go\nLet go 10x\nBaby baby da di da di dada\nBaby let go\nLet go baby gotta let it go\nDon't you let it slow your roll\nHold on to the words\nDon't you cry no more\nFor you remain in control\nBaby let go\nChorus #2",
