Can you forgive me?\nI don't want no tickets, no limo ride\nI'm the next caller on the line!\nThis is a radio message to my baby\nAnd I'm begging her\nCome back, come back\nCome back, please, come back, won't you come back?\nThis is a radio message to my baby\nAnd I'm begging her\nCome back, come back\nCome back, come back, come back\nAnd I'm sorry for treating you that way\nI'm sorry for all of those silly mistakes\nSorry I didn't do what I promised\nAnd I'm sorry you're sorry that we ever met\nAnd I'm lost without you\n'Cause I'm all about you\nWant you to hear the state of mind I'm in?\nI'm going crazy 'cause I lost my best friend\nCan you hear me, girl? Can you forgive me?\n'cause I don't want no tickets, no limo ride\nI'm the next caller on the line!\nAnd this is a radio message to my baby, oh\nAnd I'm begging her\nCome back, come back\nCome back, come back\nCome back\nSomebody let this record just rotate, oh\n'Til my baby come back\nLet it rotate, oh\n'Cause I need, I need her right back with me\nSo let it rotate\nWhatever it takes to play this record\nI need her to hear this record\nSo please, let it rotate\nBecause I'm the next caller on the line\nAnd this is a radio message to my baby\nAnd I'm begging her\nCome back, come back\nCome back, come back, come back\nThis is a radio message to my baby\nBegging her\nCome back, come back, baby\nCome back\nI need you to (come back)\nI need you to (come back)\nI need you to (come back)\nI need you to (come back)\nBaby, come back home, oh, please",
