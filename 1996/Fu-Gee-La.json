Enemy, wanna see the death of me\nFrom Hawaii to Hawthorne, I run marathons, like\nBuju Banton, I'm a true champion, like\nFarrakhan reads his daily Qur'an\nIt's a phenomenon, lyrics fast like Ramadan\n\nWhat's goin' on? Armageddon come you know we soon done\nGun by my side just in case I gotta rump\nA boy on the side of Babylon\nTryin' to front like you're down with Mount Zion\nWhat's goin' on?
