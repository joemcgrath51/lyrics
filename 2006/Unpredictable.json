Luda!\n(I like that!)\nI like it too, baby\nLet me put a little bit of excite-ment\nUp in yo lifestyle\nYou gotta know that time's of the essence\nI'm talkin' right now\nI can get, get rid of that headache\nWhat you doin' tonight?\nSome say that sex is overrated, but they just ain't doin' it right\nI keeps it interesting baby just take them clothes off\nI'll be your Tylenol just take me till you doze off\nWake you up in the middle of the night and take you to another world\nYou'll wake up in the mornin' feeling like another girl\n\nGirl get comfortable we bout to do something you never done before\nBaby not the usually tonight we getting unpredictable\nSo try to roll with me baby... baby\nI'mma make you feel like you never felt\nGirl, all because you let me get unpredictable",
