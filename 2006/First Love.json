 "lyrics": "As summer was ending, you were walking in\nIt seemed my life was falling\nBut in this season we were friends\nSix days into spring, is where our story begins\nYou didn't rush a thing\nBut you knew you would win\nCHORUS\nI never thought you'd be the only one\nI dream't of fairytales ,thats how we begun\nBut I was waiting for some magical moment\nThat would proove to me, forever would be fine\nMeanwhile my first love, was standing first in line\nOne of the first times I didn't feel alone\nIs when i was in your arms\nYou always made me feel at home\nWe watched the sunrise,cause the night had sliped away\nAnd from then until know, we've been through some different phases\nBut you love the winter, love the challenge\nAlways managed to think that we would make it\nCHORUS\nSo let me get used to things, cause gradual's my name\nI don't dive into the cold, I get in slow\nBut every day, I'm making peace with loving you\nPeace with being me\nAny pieces of us-\nI claim them all today\nCHORUS",
