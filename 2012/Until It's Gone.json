 "lyrics": "A fire needs a space to burn\nA breath to build a glow\nI've heard it said a thousand times\nBut now I know\n\nThat you don't know what you've got\nOh, you don't know what you've got\nNo, you don't know what you've got\nUntil it's gone\nUntil it's gone\nUntil it's gone\n\nI thought I kept you safe and sound\nI thought I made you strong\nBut something made me realize\nThat I was wrong\n'Cause finding what you've got sometimes\nMeans finding it alone\nAnd I can finally see your light\nWhen I let go\n\n'Cause you don't know what you've got\nUntil it's gone\nUntil it's gone\nUntil it's gone\n\nUntil it's gone\nUntil it's gone\nUntil it's gone\nUntil it's gone\nUntil it's gone\n\n'Cause you don't know what you've got\nOh, you don't know what you've got\nNo, you don't know what you've got\nIt's your battle to be fought\nNo, you don't know what you've got\nTill it's gone\nTill it's gone\nTill it's gone\n.",
