 "lyrics": "I'm so confused\nAnd I think I'm gonna cry tonight\nWhat must I do, babe?\nYou don't know what you mean, oh\nTell me something\nTell me could this really be\nYou're so unpredictable\nWhy must you treat me this way?\nI want you to love me\nFor who I am\n\nWhatever happened to the dream\nWe used to share?\nWhere did our love go?\nBoy, don't you even care?\n\nTender kisses\nBlown away\nTender kisses\nGone tomorrow, gone today\nTender kisses\nBye baby, bye baby\n\nDon't leave\nLeave me here all alone\nI want someone I can call my own\nI may be young\nBut I'm ready\nReady to fall in love\nIm so confused\nYou're so unpredictable\nTrust in me\nAs I trust in you\nPut our hearts together\nThere's nothing we can't do\n\n\n\nI wonder if you ever loved me\nTell me, was I so blind\nThat I could not see\nHolding on to the memories\nOf the way you used to kiss me\nAll I ever really wanted\nWas someone to call my own\nI'll never know\nYou'll never know\nWe'll never know\nAll those tender kisses blown away\nBye baby, bye",
