(Just me)\nIs it just me?\nOr is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?\nOh, is it just me?\nYeah, is it just me?\nOr is this sex so good I shouldn't have to\u2014\n\nFuck for free\nI know you workin' day and night to get a college degree\nBet nobody that you've been with even know you a freak, right?\nYou know you only do that with me, right?\nYeah, double checkin' on you\nYou know I never put the pressure on you\nYou know that you make your own mind up\nYou knew what it was when you signed up\nNow you gotta run it up\nI be out of words, tryna sum it up\nGirl, you throw it back like one love\nEven let me slash on the tour bus\nYeah, I talk to her but she don't do enough\nEven though you in the hood, I'm still pullin' up\nDip, dip, straight to your doorstep\nThis the real thing, can you feel the force yet?\n[Chorus: Drake & \nComplexion\n]\nI always wonder if you ask yourself (Ask yourself)\nIs it just me?
