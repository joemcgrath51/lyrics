 "lyrics": "Same old story back again\n'She's not a lover, she's just a friend'\nI'm sick and tired for you to blame on me\nNow you think it's funny\nNow you wanna spend your money on girls\nBut you forgot when you were down that I was around\nCall my lover, hang up, call again\nWhat in the world is happening?\nListen in, but don't yell at me\nIsn't it ironic? All you wanna do is smoke chronic\nBoy, you forgot when you were down who was around\n\nI can't eat, I can't sleep anymore\nWaiting for love to walk through the door\nI wish I didn't miss you anymore (anymore)\n\nMemories don't live like people do\nI'm sick for ever believing you\nWish you'd bring back the man I knew\nWas good to me, oh, lord\nEverytime you say you're coming\nBoy, you disappoint me, honey\nHow well you forgot when you were down\nAnd I was around\n\nI can't eat, I can't sleep anymore (oh, no, no)\nWaiting for love to walk through the door\nI wish I didn't miss you anymore (anymore)\nI can't eat, I can't sleep anymore\nWaiting for love to walk through the door\nI wish I didn't miss you anymore (anymore)\n\nOne of these days, it's gonna happen to you\nMissing a love like I'm missing you, babe, yeah, yeah\nOne of these days, when your dreams come true\nThat's the one that's gonna do it to you\nOh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah\n\nI can't eat, I can't sleep anymore\nWaiting for love to walk through the door\nI wish I didn't miss you anymore (anymore, yeah, yeah)\nI can't eat, I can't sleep anymore\nWaiting for love to walk through the door\nI wish I didn't miss you anymore (you anymore)\nI can't eat, I can't sleep anymore\nWaiting for love to walk through the door\nI wish I didn't miss you anymore (miss you)\nI can't eat, I can't sleep anymore\nWaiting for love to walk through the door",
