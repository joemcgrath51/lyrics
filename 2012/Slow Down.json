Slow it down, keep up\nAnd I'm killin' ya, hope I'm not offendin' ya\nSee you at the finish line, leavin' em\nBurn rubber, bu-burn rubber\nThis is how we do it when I'm dippin' on a corner\nBurn rubber, bu-burn rubber\nThis is how we do it in Northern California\n\nI tell 'em, slow down\nYou know you can't catch me\nI move too fast on the gas, don't chase me\nSlow down, slow down",
