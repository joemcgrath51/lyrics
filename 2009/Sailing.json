 "lyrics": "It's not far down to paradise\nAt least it's not for me\nAnd if the wind is right you can sail away\nAnd find tranquility\nThe canvas can do miracles\nJust you wait and see\nBelieve me\nIt's not far to never never land\nNo reason to pretend\nAnd if the wind is right you can find the joy\nOf innocence again\nThe canvas can do miracles\nJust you wait and see\nBelieve me\nSailing\nTakes me away\nTo where I've always heard it could be\nJust a dream and the wind to carry me\nAnd soon I will be free\nFantasy\nIt gets the best of me\nWhen I'm sailing\nAll caught up in the reverie\nEvery word is a symphony\nWon't you believe me\nIt's not far back to sanity\nAt least it's not for me\nAnd when the wind is right you can sail away\nAnd find serenity\nThe canvas can do miracles\nJust you wait and see\nBelieve me",
