 "lyrics": "It's just the cutest thing\nWhen you get to fussing (cussing)\nYelling and throwing things\nI just wanna eat you up\nI don't mean no disrespect\nWhen I start staring\nKnowing that it makes you madder (uh, oh)\nI'm sorry\nBut seeing you mad is so sexy\n\nCould it be the little wrinkle over your nose\nWhen you make your angry face\nThat makes me wanna just take off all your clothes\nAnd sex you all over the place\nCould it be the lil' way you storm around\nThat makes me wanna tear you down\nBaby, I ain't sure\nBut one thing that I do know is\n\nEvery time you scream at me\nI wanna kiss you\nBaby when you put your hands on me\nI wanna touch you\nAnd when we get to arguing\nJust gotta kiss you\nBaby, I don't know why it's like that\nBut you're just so damn sexy\nWhen you're mad\n\nBaby, don't think I don't take you seriously\nBut I just can't help the fact\nThat your attitude excites me\n(So exciting)\nAnd you know ain't nothing better\nThen when we get\nMad together and have angry sex\n(I'll blow you out)\nThen we forget what we were mad about\n\nCould it be the little wrinkle over your nose\nWhen you make your angry face\nThat makes me wanna just take off all your clothes\nAnd sex you all over the place\nCould it be the lil' way you storm around\nThat makes me wanna tear you down\nBaby, I ain't sure\nBut one thing that I do know is\n\nEvery time you scream at me\nI wanna kiss you\nBaby when you put your hands on me\nI wanna touch you\nAnd when we get to arguing\nJust gotta kiss you\nBaby, I don't know why it's like that\nBut you're just so damn sexy\nWhen you're mad\nEvery time you scream at me\nI wanna kiss you\nBaby when you put your hands on me\nI wanna touch you\nAnd when we get to arguing\nJust gotta kiss you\nBaby, I don't know why it's like that\nBut you're just so damn sexy\nWhen you're mad",
