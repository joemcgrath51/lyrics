Do you like love?\nYeah, well me too, me too\nIt\u2019s what we're gonna do\n\nTonight, so let\u2019s dance a little harder\n'Til I feel like I know ('Til I feel like I know)\nAll the things\n\nDo you like drugs, do you like drugs\nYeah, well me too, me too, me too, me too\nDo you like hugs? Do you like love?\nOh it feels like we got so much in common now\nRight about now baby\nMe too, me too\nIt\u2019s what we gonna do\nIt\u2019s you and me, yeah tonight\nTonight, you and me tonight\nTonight, you and me tonight\nYou and me tonight\nYou and me tonight\nYou and me yeah, tonight\nYou and me tonight, oh\nFeel like I've known you for so long\nRight about now baby, yeah, yeah\nI wanna do you like drugs tonight\nWanna do you like drugs",
