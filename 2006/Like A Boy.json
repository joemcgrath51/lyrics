 "lyrics": "I saw you looking at me I was looking at you too\nIs there somewhere we could go where we could be alone\nYou are a butterfly and I am a butterfly and we are two butterflies just hanging in the summer wind\nWhat did you say to me I thought I heard you say something to me\u2026but maybe I was wrong\nAnd if I can I will be yours for all time\nWhy do we do this to ourselves when I love you so damn much and you love me so damn much\nWhat can your father do I hate it when he treats me like a boy",
