 "lyrics": "I needed sunshine in my day\nSomething to wash away the pain\nI saw a very gentle side of him\nThat took my heart and made it sing\nI wish he'd run away and hide with me\nLove hurts so much more than it seems\nThere was one thing I didn't show\nI love him and he doesn't know\nI wonder if I ever see the day\nWill I ever find the nerve to say, I love you?\nAnd will he turn around, walk away\nWill he leave or will he stay, if I tell him?\nCould he be the one who was in my dreams?\nCould he be the one sent down for me?\nThere was one thing I failed to show, babe\nI love him and he doesn't know\nHave you ever loved somebody\nSecretly loved somebody who didn't know?\nHave you fell in love with somebody\nDeeply loved somebody who didn't know?\nI love him and he doesn't know me\nI love him and he doesn't know\nThere was one thing I didn't show, baby\nI love him and he doesn't know...",
