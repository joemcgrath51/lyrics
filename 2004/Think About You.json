 "lyrics": "Hey you, are you asleep?\nI wonder if you're out, if you are drinking\nIt's late, I know\nBut baby I ain't wasted\nCan't you call me\n\nCan't get along, can't be alone\nWhere's your mind at?\nAre you on your own?\nYou're falling out, I'm falling back\nWhere's your heart at?\nDon't you feel alone?\n\nTell me would you give us one more try?\n'Cause I, I think about, I think about you\nHeavy-hearted, trouble on my mind\n'Cause I, I think about, I think about you\n\nYour words, they burn\nI read it twice, the way you write is different\nYou're cold, and it's cruel\nActing like I am someone that you never knew\n\nCan't get along, can't be alone\nWhere's your mind at?\nAre you on your own?\nYou're falling out, I'm falling back\nWhere's your heart at?\nDon't you feel alone?\n\nTell me would you give us one more try?\n'Cause I, I think about, I think about you\nHeavy-hearted trouble on my mind\n'Cause I, I think about, I think about you\n\nI've tried, but a heart don't lie\nDon't you remember?\n'Cause I remember\n(The days when you were mine)\nI've tried, but a heart don't lie\nDon't you remember?\n'Cause I remember\n\nTell me would you give us one more try?\n'Cause I, I think about, I think about you\nHeavy-hearted, trouble on my mind\n'Cause I, I think about, I think about you\nTell me would you give us one more try?\n'Cause I, I think about, I think about you\nHeavy-hearted, trouble on my mind\n'Cause I, I think about, I think about you\n'Cause I, I think about, I think about you",
