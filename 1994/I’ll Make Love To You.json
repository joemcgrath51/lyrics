It's gonna be a long night\nThrow your clothes (Throw your clothes)\nOn the floor (On the floor)\n[Verse 4: Shawn & \nWanya\n]\nI'm gonna take my clothes off, too\nI've made plans to be within you\nGirl, whatever you ask me, you know, I could do\n\nI'll make love to you\nLike you want me to\nAnd I'll hold you tight\nBaby, all through the night\nI'll make love to you\nWhen you want me to\nAnd I will not let go\n'Til you tell me to\n\nBaby, tonight is your night\nAnd I will do you right\nJust make a wish on your night\nAnything that you ask\nI will give you the love of your life, your life, your life\n\nI'll make love to you (I'll make love)\nLike you want me to\nAnd I'll hold you tight (Hold you tight)\nBaby, all through the night\nI'll make love to you (I'll make love)\nWhen you want me to\nAnd I will not let go (Will not let go til you)\n'Til you tell me to  (tell me to)\nI'll make love to you  (I'll make love)\nLike you want me to\nAnd I'll hold you tight (Hold you tight)\nBaby, all through the night\nI'll make love to you  (I'll make love)\nWhen you want me to\nAnd I will not let go (Will not let go til you)\n'Til you tell me to (Tell me to, tell me baby)",
