Are you ready?\nOooooohhh, Oh, oh I, oh I owwwww!\nOooooohhh, Oh, oh I, oh I owwwww!\n\nWhen you're alone what you do is what you do\nI'm not scared to say\nWhen you're alone don't you ever get confused\nAin't nothing wrong with making it feel good baby\n\nI won't be afraid to touch myself\nIt's all right! I said it's all right (Hey)\nI don't think it's wrong to touch yourself\nCause ain't nothing wrong with making it feel good!\n\nEvery night I get away\nAnd I think about it baby\nYou are on my mind\nI ain't afraid to touch myself!\nI don't need nobody else!\nIt's you baby, it's you baby!\n\nWhen you're alone what you need is what you need\nOne time ecstasy\nPeople say it's not the thing to do\nBut that's the safest way to making it feel good\nHey ah!\n\nI won't be afraid to touch myself\nIt's all right! I said it's all right (Hey)\nI don't think it's wrong to touch yourself\nCause ain't nothing wrong with making it feel good!\n\nEvery night I get away\nAnd I think about it baby\nYou are on my mind\nI ain't afraid to touch myself!\nI don't need nobody else!\nIt's you baby, it's you baby!\nEvery night I get away\nAnd I think about it baby\nYou are on my mind\nI ain't afraid to touch myself!\nI don't need nobody else!\nIt's you baby, it's you baby!\n\nBaby! Hey\nOhhh\nOooooohhh, Oh, oh I, oh I owwwww!\n\nEvery night I get away\nI don't need nobody baby, I don't need nobody baby\nYou are on my mind (Don't need nobody baby, no, no, no, no)\nI ain't afraid to touch myself! (Nobody baby)\n(I don't need nobody baby, hey)\nIt's you baby (Yeah)\nEvery night I get away\nAnd I think about it baby\nYou are on my mind",
