 "lyrics": "Flashing lights (lights, lights)\nFlashing lights (lights, lights)\nFlashing lights (lights, lights)\nFlashing lights (lights, lights)\n\nShe don't believe in shootin' stars\nBut she believe in shoes and cars\nWood floors in the new apartment\nCouture from the store's departments\nYou more like \"love to start shit\"\nI'm more of the trips to Florida\nOrdered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water\nStraight from a page of your favorite author\nAnd the weather so breezy\nMan, why can't life always be this easy?\nShe in the mirror dancin' so sleazy\nI get a call like, \"Where are you, Yeezy?\"\nAnd try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte\n'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi\nDamn, these niggas got me\nI hate these niggas more than the Nazis\n\nAs I recall, I know you love to show off\nBut I never thought that you would take it this far\nBut what do I know?\nFlashing lights (lights, lights)\nWhat do I know? Know\nFlashing lights (lights, lights)\n\nI know it's been a while, sweetheart\nWe hardly talk, I was doin' my thang\nI know I was foul, baby\nAye, babe, lately, you've been all on my brain\nAnd if somebody woulda told me a month ago\nFrontin', though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know\nIf somebody woulda told me a year ago\nIt'll go get this difficult\nFeelin' like Katrina with no FEMA\nLike Martin with no Gina\nLike a flight with no Visa\nFirst class with the seat back, I still see ya\nIn my past, you on the other side of the glass\nOf my memory's museum\nI'm just sayin', hey, Mona Lisa\nCome home, you know you can't roam without Caesar\n\nAs I recall, I know you love to show off\nBut I never thought that you would take it this far\nWhat do I know?\nFlashing lights (lights, lights)\nWhat do I know? Know\nFlashing lights (lights, lights)\n\nAs you recall, you know I love to show off\nBut you never thought that I would take it this far\nWhat do you know?\nFlashing lights (lights, lights)\nWhat do you know? Know\nFlashing lights (lights, lights)\nFlashing lights (lights, lights, lights, lights...)",
