 "lyrics": "When I feel what I feel\nSometimes it's hard to tell you so\nYou may not be in the mood to learn\nWhat you think you know\nThere are times when I find\nYou wanna keep yourself from me\nWhen I don't have the strength\nI'm just a mirror of what I see\n\nBut at your best you are love\nYou're a positive motivating force within my life\nIf you ever feel the need to wonder why\nLet me know, let me know\nLove\n\nWhen you feel what you feel\nIt's hard for me to understand\nSo many things have taken place before this love affair began\nBut if you feel more like I feel\nConfusion can give way to doubt\nFor there are times when I fall short of what I say\nWhat I say I'm all about, all about\n\nBut at your best you are love\nYou're a positive motivating force within my life\nShould you ever feel the need to wonder why\nLet me know, let me know\nLove\n\n(Wait, waiting)\nLet me know\nYou niggas goin' in\nTell me what it is (Fuck it)\nWhat it is, no need to make believe\nLook beyond your world\nTry to find, find a place for me\n\n'Cause when you're at your best you are love\nYou're a positive motivating force within my life\nShould you ever feel the need to wonder why\nLet me know, let me know\nLet me know, know\nLove\n\nStay at your best baby\nLet me know, let me know",
