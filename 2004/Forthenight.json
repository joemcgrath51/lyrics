 "lyrics": "Let's pretend for one night, I'm the man in your life\nAnd we do the things that lovers do\nAll the loving you like, I give it to you just right\nThere's nothing less than special when it comes to you\n\nSee what we have is understanding\nThat works so well for how we are\nCause neither of us has the heart\nTo fall in love all over again\n\nEven though I'm not your man and I know you're not my girl\nBut let's just act like it's that way tonight\nNow I know you got your friends and you know I got some too\nBut let's just act like you're my lady tonight\n\nNow what I like about you\nIs that you're always so cool and comfortable whenever I'm around\nYou're someone that I can talk too\nNo matter what I'm going through I call on you\nCause I know you'll always be down\n\nSee what we have is so incredible\nThat we'll never find in anyone else\nThis thing that we share is so unbelievable\nThat I want you all to myself\n\nEven though I'm not your man and I know you're not my girl\nBut let's just act like it's that way tonight\nNow I know you got your friends and you know I got some too\nBut let's just act like you're my lady tonight\n\nOh, I know that we both have our separate lives\nAnd we don't keep ties on each other\nSo you can have me\nSo that I can hold you until the morning comes\nThen we can go back to how things was before\n\nEven though I'm not your man and I know you're not my girl\nBut let's just act like it's that way tonight\nNow I know you got your friends and you know I got some too\nBut let's just act like you're my lady tonight\nEven though I'm not your man and I know you're not my girl\nBut let's just act like it's that way tonight\nNow I know you got your friends and you know I got some too\nBut let's just act like you're my lady tonight\n\nTonight, tonight\nI like it (I like it)\nI love it (I love it)\nIt feels good to me (It feels good to me)\nSo good to me (So good to me)\nI like it (I like it)\nI love it (I love it)\nIt feels good to me (It feels good to me)\nSo so good to me (So so good to me)",
