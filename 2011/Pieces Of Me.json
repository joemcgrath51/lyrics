 "lyrics": "Verse 1:\nPeople just don't know what I'm about\nThey haven't seen what's there behind my smile\nThere's so much more of me I'm showin' now\n(These are the pieces of me)\nWhen it looks like I'm up sometimes I'm down\nI'm alone even when people all around\nBut that don't change the happiness I found\n(These are the pieces of me)\nChorus:\nSo when you look at my face\nYou gotta know that I'm made\nOf everything love and pain. (These are the pieces of me)\nLike every woman I know\nI'm complicated fo' sho'\nBut when I love I love til there's no love no mo'. (These are the pieces of me)\nVerse 2:\nSo many colors (That make up the woman that you see)\nA good friend and lover (Anything you want Yes I can be)\nI can run the business and make time for fantasy (These are the pieces of me)\nNow I'm gonna make mistakes from time to time\nBut in the end believe that I'm gon' fly\nNo matter if I'm wrong or if I'm right. (These are the pieces of me)\nChorus:\nSo when you look at my face\nYou gotta know that I'm made of everything love and pain. (These are the pieces of me)\nLike every woman I know\nI'm complicated fo sho\nBut when I love I love til there's no love no mo. (These are the pieces of me)\nBridge:\nOhhhh\nAs the pieces of me start to unfold\nNow I start to understand\nAll that I am\nA woman not afraid to be strong, STRONG\nChorus:\nSo when you look at my face...\nYou gotta know that I'm made of everything love and pain. (These are the pieces of me)\nLike every woman I know\nI'm complicated fo' sho'\nBut when I love I love til there's no love no mo'. (These are the pieces of me)\nI'm a woman\nA woman, a woman, woman, woman..\nYes I'm a woman, a woman, these are the pieces of me Yeaahhhh",
