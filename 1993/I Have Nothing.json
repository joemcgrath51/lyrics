 "lyrics": "Share my life, take me for what I am\n'Cause I'll never change all my colors for you\nTake my love, I'll never ask for too much\nJust all that you are and everything that you do\n\nI don't really need to look very much further\nI don't wanna have to go where you don't follow\nI won't hold it back again, this passion inside\nCan't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide\n\nBut don't make me close one more door\nI don't wanna hurt anymore\nStay in my arms if you dare\nOr must I imagine you there\nDon't walk away from me\nI have nothing, nothing, nothing\nIf I don't have you, you, you, you, you\n\nYou see through, right to the heart of me\nYou break down my walls with the strength of your love, mm\nI never knew love like I've known it with you\nWill a memory survive, one I can hold on to\n\nI don't really need to look very much further\nI don't wanna have to go where you don't follow\nI won't hold it back again, this passion inside\nI can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide\nYour love, I'll remember forever\n\nBut don't make me close one more door\nI don't wanna hurt anymore\nStay in my arms if you dare\nOr must I imagine you there\nDon't walk away from me\nI have nothing, nothing, nothing\nDon't make me close one more door\nI don't wanna hurt anymore\nStay in my arms if you dare\nOr must I imagine you there\nDon't walk away from me\nDon't walk away from me\n\nDon't you dare walk away from me\nI have nothing, nothing, nothing\nIf I don't have you, you\nIf I don't have you, oh you",
