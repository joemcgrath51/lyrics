 "lyrics": "Here, have a dollar\nIn fact, no brotherman - here, have two\nTwo dollars means a snack for me\nBut it means a big deal to you\nBe strong, serve God only\nKnow that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits\nThat's the poem I wrote for the first time\nI saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate\nMr. Wendal, that's his name\nNo one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one\nNever thought twice about spending on a ol' bum\nUntil I had the chance to really get to know one\nNow that I know him, to give him money isn't charity\nHe gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes\nAnd to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges\nStill most of y'all come out confused\nGo ahead, Mr. Wendal\nGo ahead, Mr. Wendal\nMr. Wendal has freedom\nA free that you and I think is dumb\nFree to be without the worries of a quick to diss society\nFor Mr. Wendal's a bum\nHis only worries are sickness\nAnd an occasional harassment by the police and their chase\nUncivilized we call him\nBut I just saw him eat off the food we waste\nCivilization, are we really civilized, yes or no\nWho are we to judge\nWhen thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved\nAnd killed over a racist grudge\nMr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways\nBut we don't hear him talk\nIs it his fault when we've gone too far\nAnd we got too far, cause on him we walk\nMr. Wendal, a man, a human in flesh\nBut not by law\nI feed you dignity to stand with pride\nRealize that all in all you stand tall\nMr. Wendal\nLord, Mr. Wendal",
