Here we go me and my click\nYeah I'm shinin like a light I got them diamonds on my wrist\nLemme get a hand clap, hand clap\nLil' mama breath stank so I told her bad back\nAnd hand me some water, so I can roll harder\nSlam on a hater like my name Vince Carter\nThey lookin at me crazy cause I bounce around the club\nAnd I be clappin my hands like I'm tryna kill a bug\nRow, row, row your boat gently down the stream\nAin't nobody in the club feelin like me\nPlus I got a click of gorillas in black tees\nMake the whole club clap like its some kinda disease, please\n\n\n\nWell I hope you ain't tired of clappin your hands cause we just got in the club\nI spent 75 dollars on this shirt just for the club\nHey I know we ain't leavin, lets hit the V.I.P\nWith them chickens and get freaky, lil' mama don't believe me\nI showed her, I showed her, I beat it out the frame\nI told her I'm a beast and lil' mama I'm Hurricane\nAnd now 51/50 status, shinin on haters\nJumpin, stompin, hand clappin, knockin over the tables\nIn the club we get ratchet 'til we fight\nYeah I'm stuntin in his face cause I got a big bank\nLike Big Bank Hank\nHey, cause my money don't fold\nOpen up and blind 'em with a mouth full of golds\nLemme get a hand clap, if you got that holla back\nAnd I'm outta my mind I think I need to be slapped\nLemme get a hand clap, if you got that holla back\nAnd I'm out my mind I thin I need to be slapped like that\n\n\n\nNow drop that beat, turn it up\nThat's too loud man, turn it down, now turn it back up\nPut your hands up and make them clap, cause now we on\nAnd if you ain't gon' make your hands clap, then stay at home\nYou got a pocket full of money, huh, well that's what's up\nLemme catch you by the bathroom, you gon' get snuck\nAround the E-A-S-E-T-C-G , I'm Hurricane\nS-O-U-T-H-S-I-D-E, that's what I claim\nLemme see you put your arm up and your Rick James\nI get to clappin my hands like I'm fin' to go insane\nLil' mama wanna marry me, just gimme some brain\nGrippin grippin the grain, lemme see you Rick James\n1 for the 1 for the money, 2 for the show\nAll y'all haters better slow your roll\nBut you ain't gotta chill, I can make you chill with a backslap\nSecurity won't trip, they would think I'm doin the hand clap",
