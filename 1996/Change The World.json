 "lyrics": "If I could reach the stars\nPull one down for you\nShine it on my heart\nSo you could see the truth\nThat this love I have inside\nIs everything it seems\nBut for now I find\nIt's only in my dreams\n\nAnd I can change the world\nI will be the sunlight in your universe\nYou would think my love was really something good\nBaby if I could change the world\n\nIf I could be king\nEven for a day\nI'd take you as my queen\nI'd have it no other way\nAnd our love would rule\nIn this kingdom we have made\n'Til then I'd be a fool\nWishing for the day\n\nAnd I can change the world\nI would be the sunlight in your universe\nYou would think my love was really something good\nBaby if I could change the world\nBaby if I could change the world\n\nI could change the world\nI would be the sunlight in your universe\nYou would think my love was really something good\nBaby if I could change the world\nBaby if I could change the world\nBaby if I could change the world",
