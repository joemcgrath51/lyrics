 "lyrics": "From the CO to across the seas\nI'm guaranteed to make everybody bounce wit me\nI been known to rip it down anyplace I be\nYou can copy but it's only gon' be one me\nI don't ride no cars, if the man come, remember 14\nI done started up a whole epidemic\nLook, y'all know what I'm talkin' about\nEver since I hooked up with the homey down south\nTV shows, magazine covers\nGirls in groups say we go wit each other\nSold out shows, pocket full of cake\nWhat you know about sellin' tres mil out the gate?\nSee, I'm the hottest (hottest) thing around\nNeck full of bling bling like the Neptunes' sound\nI got it locked from the left, right, front, and rear\nWhen I step up in the spot this is all I hear\n\nLil' Bow Wow, you just don't know\nThe way you move so fast across the floor\nI mean you run through my mind like all the time\nTo the point that I just wanna take you home\nI said Lil' Bow Wow, you just don't know\nThe way you move so fast across the floor\nI mean you run through my mind like all the time\nTo the point that I just wanna take you home\n\nRepresent that - (So So Def)\n\nRight now when I'm old, where I'm gonna be\nHave a flow, homey you can bet the house on me\nI'mma forever be up under the scope\nI ain't tryna go out like Todd Bridges of \"Different Strokes\"\nI was born to rock, born to rhyme\nWhat you lookin' at is something that's before they time\nLike the number 23 in the red and black\nMr. 106 and Park is back, Holla\nI do it like no other\nAnd attract more family than 'Ringling Brothers'\nI got 'em scattered, covered, smothered like, hash browns\nSee, I'm the best just ask around\nYo, I'm here now and ain't nobody takin' mine\nIt's a waste of time if you thinkin' you can\nYou better off gettin a shirt\nMakin a sign that reads, \"SHAD MOSS, I'm your #1 fan\"\n - repeat 2X",
