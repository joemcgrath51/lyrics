 "lyrics": "Land of the free, but the skin I'm in identifies me\nSo the people around me energize me\nCallin' all aboard this train ride\nTalkin' 'bout raw hardcore, leavin' frauds on the outside\nBut the bad thing is anyone can ride the train\nAnd the reason for that is cause we look the same\nLookin' all around at my so called friend\nLight skin to the brown, the black, here we go again\nHomey over there knows Keith an, but he be thiefin'\nI don't trust him, rather bust 'em up\nOut goes his hand and I cough\nHe once stole from me, yeah I wanna cut it off\nThe black thing is a ride I call the nighttrain\nIt rides the good and the bad, we call the monkey trained\nTrained to attack the black and it's true\nCause some of them lookin' just like you\n\nStayin' on the scene, sittin' on the train\nSee all the faces look about the same\nThere go the sellout who's takin' a ride like Cargo\nCause he deal the keys from Key Largo\nRunnin' Nat narcotic, by George he got it\nTakin' makin' the Gs erotic\nAnd the fiends they scheme, so he can put 'em down\nBut his method is wreck 'em, I put 'em in the ground\nGot the nerve as hell to yell brother man\nHe ain't black man better yet he's Pac Man\nKnown to murder his own, traitor on the phone\nRidin' the train, self-hater trained to sell pain\nThe master's toy, his little boy\nHard to avoid he look wit' it but he null 'n' void\nCause he ridin' the train you think he down for the cause\nCause his face lookin' just like yours\n\nMore of the same, insane who sayin'\nI'm flowin' like nighttrain, runnin' the pain of the black reign\nYou look, you laugh, you doubt and go out\nAnd I'm gone, but the bass goes on\nTo talk the talk, but walk the walk, the king of New York\nCrack a lack, attack the black, to crack the back\nOnce again I test a friend with sincerity\nOr consider him an enemy\nWho am I to tell a lie, rather push the Bush\nHope the cracker gets crushed, I'm rollin' with Rush\nLeader of the bum rush\nRussian I ain't! Spreadin' like paint!\nLookin' at the pot I got and it's kickin'\nBut it ain't chicken, but it's livin' for a city, so sick 'n' tired\nOf a scene buckwild\nPiled in a file, senile or child\nThey said it never been no worser than this\nI'm on the nighttrain, they hope ya don't miss it\nGive ya what they got to give you, just go\nYou musn't just put your trust in every brother, yo\nSome don't give a damn, cause they the other man\nWorse than a bomb, posin' as Uncle Toms\nDisgracin' the race, and blowin' up the whole crew\nWith some of them lookin' just like you",
