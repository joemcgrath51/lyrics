 "lyrics": "I was reborn when I was broken\nI wouldn't believe, I wouldn't believe, no\nBeen through a storm, no use in hoping\nThat you would come rescue me\nSomehow your love set me free\n\nAnd I, I can let my life pass me by\nOr I can get down and try\nWork it all out this lifetime\nWork it on out this time\nI can let it all pass me by\nOr I can get down and try\nWork it all out this lifetime, lifetime\n\nThere was a time when love wasn't chosen\nNow I'm just open for more\nNow I'm just reaching out for something better\nThat I had before, girl\nThere ain't a bottom line in your world\n\nOoh, and I, I can let my life pass me by\nOr I can get down and try\nWork it all out this lifetime\nWork it on out this time\nI can let it all pass me by\nOr I can just try and try\nI can move to the light\n\nOh, if I take it one day at a time\nOh, spread my love out and fly, oh, I\n(I can move to the light)\nOoh, I can just make you understand\nThat love is not a fairy tale in a melody\nIf you want it you can have it, girl\nMaybe you will see, maybe you will see\nLifetime, lifetime\n\nOoh, and I, I can let my life pass me by\nI can just try and try\nWork it all out this lifetime, lifetime\nI can let it all pass me by\nOr I can just, alright now\nLifetime, lifetime\nI can let my life pass me by\nWork it on\nLifetime, lifetime\nI can let my life pass me by\nThere's no way, there's no way\nI won't leave you, I won't leave\nLifetime, lifetime\nI can let my life pass me by\nOh, you're so mine, baby\nLifetime, lifetime",
