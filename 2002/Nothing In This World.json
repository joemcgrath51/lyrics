 "lyrics": "Ooh, yeah, oooh, yeah, yeah\n\nI can picture us in the living room\nBy the mantlepiece\nAnd you're tellin' me you're lovin' me\nWith your hands on my thighs\nWhile I'm starin' in your brown eyes\nAnd the expression on your face\nIs tellin' me you want more than a taste\nSo tonight we're goin' all the way\nWe'll be lovin' 'til the break of day\n\nThere's nothin' in this world I wouldn't do for you, boy\nI don't care what the others say now that I got you, babe\nNo one can bring me joy like you girl\nAll the little things you do\nIts all about you boo\n\nI can picture us runnin' in the rain\nAfter a movie then we spark a flame\nOh I love it when you scream my name\nGoing 60 in the 3rd lane\nWe pull over to the parkin' lot\nIn the Park, that's my favorite spot\nDoing just about anything\nWe'll be goin' 'til the birds sing\n\nThere's nothin' in this world I wouldn't do for you, boy\nI don't care what the others say now that I got you, babe\nNo one can bring me joy like you girl\nAll the little things you do\nIts all about you boo\n\nI think its bout time that I make you mine\nOh what you're saying to me boy come on break it down\nTo find another like you will be a lifetime\nI think I see where you're going baby let it out let it out\nListen to me baby got something to say\nIs it really what I think don't take all-day\nForever is what I wanna give to you so what do you say\nBaby I do\n\nThere's nothin' in this world I wouldn't do for you, boy\nI don't care what the others say now that I got you, babe\nNo one can bring me joy like you girl\nAll the little things you do\nIts all about you boo\nThere's nothin' in this world I wouldn't do for you, boy\nI don't care what the others say now that I got you, babe\nNo one can bring me joy like you girl\nAll the little things you do\nIts all about you boo",
