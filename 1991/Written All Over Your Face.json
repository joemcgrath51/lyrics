 "lyrics": "Ah yeah, it's the home of the microphone master, Houdini\nI'm dope, some don't believe me\nUnless, I stress and bust a cap from steel\nAim for the dome, show em that I'm real hardcore\nThe underground rapper who's wrecking\nI pack a Smith and Wesson on my right section\nI'm strapped, at all time, Jack\nNine mill's the gat, for a punk chump new jack\nI must stay focus and keep my mind open\nThe world's mass confusion, there mad guns smoking\nFor punks trying to get respect and yearning\nMess around and catch a bad one from Erick Sermon\nI'm serious, boy, but not Jermaine Jackson\nI also have a 12 gauge shotgun for action\nSo chill, back the hell up and get a grip\nGet off that, thinking that you're all that real quick\nLike the Rude Boys said\nIt's written all over your face, punk, nobody's safe\nNobody's safe chump, so keep your doors locked(4x)\n\nIt's the hardcore rap music that make your ears ring\nDroids of funk, produce a song to make my fans sing\nSinging, swinging, hum along, thump my rap song\nI bet I get wreck on a DL, then the P's gone\nPoof, no phonebooth, cape, or tight suit\nDress in all black, black skullcap, black down goose\nTo hide the mossberg, word, wit the pistol grip\nSqueeze em quick, so use caution wit the loose lip\nCuz loose lips sink ships, don't be the ship to catch a nine clip\nI ain't going out on some bull----\nBankshot, corner pocket, now watch me rock it\nCan't mock the rap style so, boy, stop it\n(So what's the name)John Doe, 'K it's a slow flow\nSwift Smith, crazy, the boy's loco\nLike Neon Deion Sanders, call him primetime\n(It's the new style) time to get mine\nCuz nobody's safe in the fast pace of the rap race\nSo keep your hoodies on and your boots laced\nNow I'm out, beaming back to the boon dox\nNobody's safe chump, so keep your doors locked",
