 "lyrics": "I used to think that I could not go on\nAnd life was nothing but an awful song\nBut now I know the meaning of true love\nI'm leaning on the everlasting arms\n\nIf I can see it, then I can do it\nIf I just believe it, there's nothing to it\n\nI believe I can fly\nI believe I can touch the sky\nI think about it every night and day\nSpread my wings and fly away\nI believe I can soar\nI see me running through that open door\nI believe I can fly\nI believe I can fly\nI believe I can fly (Woo)\n\nSee I was on the verge of breaking down\nSometimes silence can seem so loud\nThere are miracles in life I must achieve\nBut first I know it starts inside of me, ho-oh\n\nIf I can see it (Woo), then I can be it\nIf I just believe it, there's nothing to it\n\nI believe I can fly\nI believe I can touch the sky\nI think about it every night and day\nSpread my wings and fly away\nI believe I can soar\nI see me running through that open door\nI believe I can fly\nI believe I can fly\nOh I believe I can fly (Woo)\n\nHey, 'cause I believe in me\nOhhh\n\nIf I can see it (Woo), then I can do it (I can do it)\nIf I just believe it, there's nothing to it (Hey!)\n\nI believe I can fly (Woo!)\nI believe I can touch the sky\nI think about it every night and day\nSpread my wings and fly away\nI believe I can soar\nI see me running through that open door\nI believe I can fly (I can fly)\nI believe I can fly (I can fly)\nI believe I can fly (I can fly)\nHey, if I just spread my wings (I can fly)\nI can fly (I can fly)\nI can fly (I can fly)\nI can fly, hey (I can fly)\nIf I just spread my wings (I can fly)\nI can fly (I can fly) (I can fly)\n(Woo!) (I can fly)\n\nFly-eye-eye",
