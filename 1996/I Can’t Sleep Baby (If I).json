 "lyrics": "Girl I must have been crazy to say that it was over\nI had to be a fool to yell out we were through\nAnd now I'm all alone and feeling down and out baby\nWhen I never meant for this to end\nIt was so, so crazy of me\nSometimes we say things that we really don't mean\nWell I'm sorry baby\nBring your loving back to me\n\nI can't sleep babe\nI can't think babe\nI can't live babe\nWithout you in my life\nI can't go on babe\nThis is my song baby\nDon't wanna do nothing if I, go away baby\nAnd I can't do nothing if you're, not around\n\nThough I must admit that things got out of hand\nWhen you told me that he was just a friend\nI should've had my trust in you\nFrom the very start darling\nCause I never meant for this to end\nHow can we get it back again?\nOh sometimes a man can say things\nThat he really don't mean\nWell I'm sorry baby\nBring your loving back to me\n\nI can't sleep babe\nI can't think babe\nI can't live babe\nWithout you in my life\nI can't go on babe\nThis is my song baby\nDon't wanna do nothing if I, go away baby\nAnd I can't do nothing if you're, not around\n\nBaby, can we meet somewhere and talk about it?\nOh baby, can we work it out?\nI'm not gonna let you go my baby\nBefore I let you know that\n\nI can't sleep babe\nI can't think babe\nI can't live babe\nWithout you in my life\nI can't go on babe\nThis is my song baby\nDon't wanna do nothing if I, go away baby\nAnd I can't do nothing if you're, not around",
