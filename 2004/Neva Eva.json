You must be playing a plan in the field\nAll our plans to plant seeds on land to rebuild\nSo I never have to worry about a mil'\nThink about it\nI'm been about it since 'Bout It, 'Bout It from Percy Miller\nAnd word to me and his brothers, see all my verses killer\nNever penned the verses filler\nMy shit is stellar though\nBut Hov ain't telling y'all, so you never know\nEven if I never blow, pray that I never ever be broke again\nShit, we was never even supposed to win\nNever say \"never\" but this my last thought\nSome of y'all never gon' fill a passport\nI'm on my second, this ain't no Jansport\nAll of my luggage is Louie truly\nA deed and a title when nothing was given to me\nHustle was running through me\nNever stunting, never faking, never fronting\nNever ran into anybody that want it\nNeva eva",
