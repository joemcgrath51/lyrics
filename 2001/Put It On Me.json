(Uh)\nI only think about you (Yeah)\nI know you're tired of being lonely (Lonely)\nSo baby girl, put it on me (Put it on me)\nWhat would I be without you?

(Uh)\nI only think about you (Yeah)\nI know you're tired of being lonely (Lonely)\nSo baby girl, put it on me (Put it on me)\nWhat would I be without you? (Uh)\nI only think about you (Yeah)\nI know you're tired of being lonely (Lonely)\nSo baby girl, put it on me (Put it on me)\n\nSince we met, it's been you and I\nA tear for a tear, baby, eye for an eye\nAnd you know that my heart gon' cry\nIf you leave me lonely\n'Cause you not just my love, you my homie\nWho's gonna console me, my love?\nI'm outta control, hold me, my love\n'Cause I'm yours\nAnd I don't wanna do nothin' to hurt my baby girl\nIf this was our world, it'd be all yours, baby\nThe thought alone might break me\nAnd I don't wanna go crazy\n'Cause every thug needs a lady (Yeah, yeah)\nI feel you, baby, 'cause them eyes ain't lying\nWash away all the tears, there be no more crying (Baby)\nAnd you complete me, and I would die if you ain't wit me\nSo baby girl, put it on me\n\nWhat would I be without you? (Uh)\nI only think about you (Yeah)\nI know you're tired of being lonely (Lonely)\nSo baby girl, put it on me (Put it on me)\nWhat would I be without you? (Uh)\nI only think about you (Yeah)\nI know you're tired of being lonely (Lonely)\nSo baby girl, put it on me (Put it on me)\nWhat would I be without you? (Uh)\nI only think about you (Yeah)\nI know you're tired of being lonely (Lonely)\nSo baby girl, put it on me (Put it on me)\nWhat would I be without you? (Uh)\nI only think about you (Yeah)\nI know you're tired of being lonely (Lonely)\nSo baby girl, put it on me (Put it on me)",
