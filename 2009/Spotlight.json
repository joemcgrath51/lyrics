Is that you?)\nDo we stay home all the time because you want me to yourself?\n(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?)\nOr am I locked away, out of fear that I'll find someone else?\n(Is that you? Is that you? Yeah)\n\nWell, I don't like\nLiving under your spotlight\nJust because you think I might\nFind somebody worthy (Worthy)\nNo, I don't like\nLiving under your spotlight\nMaybe if you treat me right\nYou won't have to worry\n\nIs this a relationship fulfilling your needs as well as mine?\n(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?)\nOr is this just my sentence? Am I doing time?\n(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?)\nOh, if this love, real real love, then I'm staying, no doubt\n(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?)\nBut if I'm just love's prisoner, then I'm bustin' out\n(Is that you? Is that you? Yeah)\n\nOh, baby, I don't like\nLiving under your spotlight (Spotlight)\nJust because you think I might (Just because you think I might)\nFind somebody worthy (Find somebody worthy)\nNo, I don't like (I don't like)\nLiving under your spotlight (Living under your, under your)\nMaybe if you treat me right (Treat me right)\nYou won't have to worry (You won't have to worry, no, no)\n\nOh, you oughta be\nAshamed of yourself\nWhat the hell do you think you're doing\nLovin' me, lovin' me?\nSo wrong\nBaby, all I do is try (Try)\nTo show you that you're my (My)\nOne and only guy (My guy)\nNo matter who may come along\nOpen your eyes, 'cause baby, I don't like\n\nHey, 'cause I don't like\nLiving under your spotlight (Oh no)\nJust because you think I might\nFind somebody worthy (Find somebody worthy)\nNo, I don't like\nLiving under your spotlight (Living under your spotlight)\nMaybe if you treat me right (Treat me right, yeah)\nYou won't have to worry (You don't ever have to worry)\n\nI don't like",
