 "lyrics": "If I could be honest, here in this moment\nI've been so nervous to stand here with you\nThey're all here for us and I feel their aura\nBut just for a moment I'll pretend it's just you\n\nYes they can hear us, but they don't understand\nI have said all of my vows behind the curtains\nI know they see us, but they don't stand a chance\nI have kissed those lips a thousand times before this\n\nTomorrow I'll open my eyes\nAnd I will whisper to my wife\n\"I belong to you\"\nAnd I will wait to hear you say\nAs a tear rolls down your face\n\"I belong to you\"\n\nIf I could be honest, here at the altar\nI refuse to grow older unless it's with you\nI fell in love and made you a promise\nThough I'd never noticed how much it meant to you\n\nYes they can hear us, but they misunderstand\nThere is more behind these words that we have spoken\nI know they see us, but only at a glance\nOnly you know the man that I am beyond the surface\n\nTomorrow I'll open my eyes\nAnd I will whisper to my wife\n\"I belong to you\"\nAnd I will wait to hear you say\nAs a tear rolls down your face\n\"I belong to you\"\n\nI belong with you\nWhen they let us choose\nI will say I do\nI belong with you\nWhen they let us choose\nI will say I do\n\nTomorrow I'll open my eyes\nAnd I will whisper to my wife\n\"I belong to you\"\nAnd I will wait to hear you say\nAs a tear rolls down your face\n\"I belong to you\"",
