 "lyrics": "I miss you, I miss you\n\nHello, there\nThe angel from my nightmare\nThe shadow in the background of the morgue\nThe unsuspecting victim\nOf darkness in the valley\nWe can live like Jack and Sally if we want\nWhere you can always find me\nAnd we'll have Halloween on Christmas\nAnd in the night, we'll wish this never ends\nWe'll wish this never ends\n\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\n\nWhere are you?\nAnd I'm so sorry\nI cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight\nI need somebody and always\nThis sick, strange darkness\nComes creeping on, so haunting every time\nAnd as I stare, I counted\nThe webs from all the spiders\nCatching things and eating their insides\nLike indecision to call you\nAnd hear your voice of treason\nWill you come home and stop this pain tonight?\nStop this pain tonight\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and \nMark Hoppus\n]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\n[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and \nMark Hoppus\n]\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\nDon't waste your time on me, you're already\nThe voice inside my head (\nI miss you, I miss you\n)\n\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you\nI miss you, I miss you",
