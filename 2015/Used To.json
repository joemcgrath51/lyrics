Mmmm, pheromones\nGot a fuckin' halo over my devil horns\nTrap pumpin' all night like Chevron\nSuck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6\nFuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry\nYou can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry\nI was only five, but still remember the drought in '87\nLord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em\nI ain't got no time\nTell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence\nI'm fuckin' her mind\nI got, mind control over Deebo\nParmesan my panino\nPromethazine over pinot\nAnd when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch\n\nI ain't felt the pressure in a little while\nIt's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)\nFloatin' all through the city with the windows down\nPuttin' on like I used to (What you say?)\nThey never told me when you get the crown\nIt's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)\nNew friends all in their old feelings now\nThey don't love you like they used to, man\n\nYeah, they don't love you like they used to (What you say?)\nIn the city with the- windows down\nLike I used to (What you say?)\nLike I\nTake some to getting used to (What you say?)\nMan, they don't love you like they used to, man",
