I refuse, yeah\n\nI just wanna be the one\nBut to you, we\u2019re already done\nTell me, why'd you have to hit and run me?\nNow I'm all alone, cryin' ugly\nYou broke my heart just for fun\nTook my love and just left me numb\nNow it's eight in the morning\nHate in the morning (All because of you)\n\nAnother story that's sad and true\nI can feel the pain, can you?\nYou had to be the one to let me down\nTo colour me blue\nHate to see you with someone new\nI'll put a curse on her and you\nAin't no looking back, now you're dead and gone\nMy love is gone too\n\nAll my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one\nAll my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one\nAll my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one\nAll my love is gone\nNow you're dead and gone",
