 "lyrics": "Back to the grill again, the grill again\n\nYou need a posse the size of the Nazis to attack this\nAnd you're more optimistic than the Sounds of Blackness\nFlip rhymes that rip through the chest cavity\nAnd I keep goin' and goin' just like an Energizer battery\nFlattery will get you nowhere, unless it's the derriere\nAnd then it gets you everywhere\nWent to the flea market, was in my car, I parked it\nBeef like blunts, if you got it, then spark it\nAnd with the fisticuffs came the fists\nAnd you've joined Steven Segal on the Marked for Death hit-list\nWent back to the '70s and brothers got on grins\n'Cause they can step to sisters and say \"Slap me some skins\nHoneydip\", and take the \nsquaw\n to the teepee\nHit it off, smoke a cig, watch a little TV\nAnd if there ain't no papes, there's no show\nI'll just chill and return to kick 'em in the... grill\n\n\nWord up! MC Serch, that was fly\nWe gonna try like this, though, um...\n\nBust a style while I do it, if you know it, oh, you knew it\nIf you knew it then you knew it, if I catch a punk chewin'\nI'mma drop the flavor fluid on his head, yep, I flew it\nAnd like Aretha Franklin, your moms is jumpin' to it\nSo, so, so, where did you go, what do you know?\nSo many people want to be fly like \nJoe\nG.I., E.I., oh\n, lots and lots\nAnd any rapper can top the Red Hot (Not!)\nR&B rips hip-hop (Not!)\nMC Serch is gonna flip-flop (Not!)\nAll my hoes look like Sasquatch (Not!)\nAnd uh, George Bush gets enough props\nWell, uh, anyway, I'mma slay, slay, lay\nPull a hoe around my way and make hooker souffl\u00e9\nRed Hot Lover Tone would like to thank MC Serch\nYo, you're chill for makin' me part of history\nKickin' 'em in the grill!\n\nFinesser, keep a Tec-9 in my dresser\nLyrical professor\n, \nkeep ya under pressure\nMind like a computer, the inserter\nParagraphs of murder\n, \nthe nightclub flirter\nThis is Nas, kid, you know how it runs\nI'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns\nStickin' up the preachers in the church, I'm a stoned crook\nSerial killer, who works by the phone book\nFor you, I got a lot to shoot and songs to hear\nMy rhymes are hotter than a prostitute with gonorrhea\nOn the mic, I let vocabulary spill\n(It's like that, y'all!) That, y'all\n, \nkick 'em in the grill!\n\n\n\"Jump, jump, with the man, with the plan, Chubb Rock\"\n\nThe Chubbsta breaks, head nods, he fakes, steady rate H\nThe panty mix the verse, looks to Serch, kick him in the grill again\nPart 2, sequel of \"The Dialect, The Derelict\"\nThe murder list, \nVanilla kicks it to climb on the crucifix\nComin' around the mountain\nWhen he comes to sell the record bumps\nDigest the lyrics then you suck on some Tums\nCrumbs with the energy from the lump sums\nAnd lips to to the mixture to the friction and then you're hummin'\nThe door rings, yo, I'm comin'\nTo a theater near you, get your popcorn and your brew\nAnd a \nGuinness Stout\n, check the clout when I'm about\n'Cause YOU! are a BLABBERMOUTH!\nA blabber, it gets no badder\nLyrics on a diet 'cause it gets no fatter\nLike a Gwen to the Guthrien, jumpin' up on the scene\nWith the Serches with the verses, word up, the illustrious\nRapper, dapper, snapper fish, you want us to sell out your wish\nMy lips have never touched the circumference of a spliff\nAnd if you see some coke or some spill\nWith some ill pill, yo, kick me in the grill, grill\n\n\n\"So get up and get down\"\n\"Serch'll never stand still\"\n\nSo here's a true or false, tell me if it's \nfact or bull\n:\nYou wanna kill the Klan, shoot the fans at a tractor pull\nGot crazy game, so no one can stop me\nBut ayo, I'm white, I guess my game is hockey\nOr basketball, football, takin' papes in poker\nIf honeydip got a moneyclip, I'm gonna stroke her\nWait a minute, chill, chill, can't swing\n'Cause my girl ain't my girl no more, now she got a ring\nRespect my wisdom like I respect myself\nTry the G, I'll put you in a tree just like the Keebler elves\nYou couldn't be The Mack if you had the car, the hat, the ho\nAnd your shit would still be out the back like a patio\n'Cause I saw you eatin' pig knuckles, with\n \nFrankie Knuckles\nIn a club called Chuckles, wearin' name plate belt buckles\nGoddamn, your life is flimsy\nGave you 'nuff respect, but took it back 'cause I was stingy\nSo from the cons and pros to the pros and the cons\nCall me a motherfucker, I'll say, \"Yeah, I fucked your moms\"\nUntil she calls back, I'm gonna chill\nPeace to Red Hot Lover Tone, Chubb Rock, kick 'em in the grill",
