Mart where they left my nigga\nWon't be that long, yeah, it'll be a while\n'Til my love life right again, killas on side again\nButterflies, paradise, them bullets left out the wind\n\nIf I say how I feel, would you really listen?\nIf you was all mine, I'd be all in\n\nIf I took the clean route, bank accounts got cleaned out\nWe'll still be at war, ridin' with the mops, tryna wipe the block down\n.50 rounds on the bottom of that Glock, standin' in front mom's house\nSteady screamin', \"Gang life,\" know my time comin' 'round\n\nIf I say how I feel, would you really listen?\nIf you was all mine, I'd be all in\nIf I say how I feel, would you really listen?\nIf you was all mine, I'd be all in\n\n12Hunna on the beat\nGoddamn, BJ with another one",
