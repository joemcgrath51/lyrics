 "lyrics": "Love, let's talk about love\nIs it anything and everything you hoped for?\nOr do the feeling haunt you?\nI know the feeling haunt you\n\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer\n\nTell me what you gon' do to me\nConfrontation ain't nothin' new to me\nYou can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue\nBut you can't bring the truth to me\nFuck you and all your expectations\nI don't even want your congratulations\nI recognize your false confidence\nAnd calculated promises all in your conversation\nI hate people that feel entitled\nLook at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you\nOh, you important?\nYou the moral to the story? You endorsin'?\nMotherfucker, I don't even like you\nCorrupt a man's heart with a gift\nThat's how you find out who you dealin' with\nA small percentage who I'm buildin' with\nI want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'\nOn my momma, that's the realest shit\n\nLet's talk about love\nIs it anything and everything you hoped for?\nOr do the feeling haunt you?\nI know the feeling haunt you\n\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer\n\nSkin covered in ego\nGet to talkin', I get involved, like a rebound\nNo control, no off switch\nAnd the way that you bringin' me down\nIt's a turn on, get away from me\nKnow you mean wrong, keep away from me\nAnd it's all wrong, get away from me, yeah\nI, I just cry for no reason\nI just pray for no reason\nI just thank for the life, for the day\nFor the hours and another life breathin'\nI did it all 'cause it feel good\nYou could live it all if you feel bad\nBetter live your life, we were runnin' out of time\n\nLet's talk about love\nIs it anything and everything you hoped for?\nOr do the feeling haunt you?\nI know the feeling haunt you\n\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer\nThis may be the night that my dreams might let me know\nAll the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer",
