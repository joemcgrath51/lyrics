 "lyrics": "She stepped out of the Taxi, with a suitcase in her hand\nAnd a hand bag too full for her to hold\nI felt her body tremble as I took her in my arms\nAnd she whispered, don't ever let me go\nChorus:\nThen I watched her hang her dresses up and close the closet door\nAnd I watched her put her satin things away\nSomehow now I know she won't be leaving anymore\nI do believe forever's here to stay\n--- Instrumental ---\nIt's good to hear her foot steps just walking down the hall\nLord, I wondered would I hear those sounds again\nWe're picking up the pieces and putting away the past\nWe've got a lot of broken dreams to mend\nChorus:\nI watched her hang her dresses up and close the closet door\nAnd I watched her put her satin things away\nSomehow now I know she won't be leaving anymore\nI do believe forever's here to stay\nI do believe forever's here to stay...",
