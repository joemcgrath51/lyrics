Diddy)\nPlay with my emotions, you gets no devotion\nYou gets no love, gets no love\nYou can't get no love from me\nYou can't even be my friend (yeah)\nAnd you gets no love again (come on)\nSaid you gets no love, gets no love\n(Ayo, Faith, let me talk to 'em one time, check this out)\nYou gets no love from me\n\nYo, how the situation get so raw\nTo the point we don't kiss no more\nThings I miss, you don't miss no more\nThat night I met you on the disco floor\nEvery night since missed you more\nMaking hits on tour\nNow when I knock, you don't answer the door\nThe phone ring, you don't answer no more\n'Cause you ain't tryna chance it no more\nGot to find me a new diva\nSomething pretty for P. Diddy and his two-seater\n\nNow you could never have a piece of my love\nSo when you see me don't reach for no hug\nAnd don't speak in the club\nDon't tell me how you deeply in love\nOther day you tried to greet me with thugs\nThat wanted to heat me with slugs\nSee the message on my beeper was bugged\nTry to chill, lay deep in the cut\nBut you keeping it up\nEven my girl think of beating you up\nThe way you keeping in touch\nShe don't know if niggas cheating or what\n\nBoy, we had a cool relationship\nBut you couldn't handle it\nPlay with my emotions, you gets no devotion\nWhatever you do it will come back to you\nYou can't even be my friend\nAnd you gets no love again\nSaid you gets no love, gets no love, gets no love from me\nPlay with my emotions, you gets no devotions\nWhatever you do it will come back to you\nYou can't even be my friend\nAnd you gets no love again\nYou gets no love from me",
