 "lyrics": "Cold endless summer days\nSince you went away\nTore my heart in two\nAnd now wandering through the night\nI see the city lights\nFeelin' so in need\nI'll never be at peace\n\nLove you all my lifetime\nLost to you eternally\nEverything in my life\nTells me we were meant to be\n\nStrange there's always something wrong\nDreams don't last that long\nWhat part did I play in that game\nAnd now, now you turn away\nExcuses are too late\nFeelin' so in need, i'll never be at peace\n\nLove you all my lifetime (Love you all my life)\nLost to you eternally\nEverything in my life (My life, my life)\nTells me we were meant to be\n\nMiss you every minute\nHoping for another chance\nI hope that you can see that\nAnd we can start a new romance\n\nYou make the rain and the night go away\nYou make the sun rise up in my sky\nYou make the rain and the night go away\nYou make the sun rise up in my sky\n\nLove you all my life, my life, my life\nLove you all my lifetime...\nEverything in my life...",
