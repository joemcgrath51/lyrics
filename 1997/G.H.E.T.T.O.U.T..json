 "lyrics": "Sittin' there, sittin' there\nSittin' there\nAll alone\nI been feeling kinda strange lately\nI don't know what's going on, baby\nEver since I came back from out of town\nSomething's telling me some bullshit is going down\n\nBoy is it someone else you're seeking\nIs it someone else\nMy vitals' telling me you're creeping\nFinding numbers in your jeans\nYou're talking in your sleep\nFaded letters written by me get o-u-t\n\nNo more sittin' at home alone\nWhile you're out with somebody else\nNo more staring at the phone\n'Cos I can do better by myself\nYeah, it's obvious how things have changed within the year\nJust give me half of the rent and get out of here\nNo more talking save your lying for somebody else\nKeep on walking 'cos I can do better by myself\n\nBoy is it someone else you're seeking\nIs it someone else\nMy vitals' telling me you're creeping\nFinding numbers in your jeans\nYou're talking in your sleep\nFaded letters written by me get o-u-t\n\nNo more sittin' at home alone\nWhile you're out with somebody else\nNo more staring at the phone\n'Cos I can do better by myself\n\nNo more sittin' at home alone\nWhile you're out with somebody else\nNo more staring at the phone\n'Cos I can do better by myself\nI gave you all, all of my time\nBut you would not know a good thing\nIf it stares you in your face\n\nBoy is it someone else you're seeking\nIs it someone else\nMy vitals' telling me you're creeping\nFinding numbers in your jeans\nYou're talking in your sleep\nFaded letters written by me get o-u-t\n\nNo more sittin' at home alone\nWhile you're out with somebody else\nNo more staring at the phone\n'Cos I can do better by myself\n\nNo more sittin' at home alone\nWhile you're out with somebody else\nNo more staring at the phone\n'Cos I can do better by myself\nOh oh oh oh\nHey ey ey ey\nOh oh oh oh\n\nNo more sittin' at home alone\nWhile you're out with somebody else\nNo more staring at the phone\n'Cos I can do better by myself",
