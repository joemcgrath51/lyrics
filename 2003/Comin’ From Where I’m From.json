 "lyrics": "Sitting here guess I didn't make bail\nGot time and a story to tell\nStarted when I was nine years old\nWoke up my daddy was gone\nI started hustling they couldn't tell me nothing\nFronting in the hood trying to be somebody\nMy soul was on empty\nI was searching for something\n\nTried to be good; Tried to keep from trouble\nLiving too fast; Trying to make good on a hustle\n\nSometimes it gets rough\nComing from where I'm from, I'm from\nTimes have got hard\nComing from where I'm from, I'm from\nSome times you gotta walk to work\nComing from where I'm from, I'm from\nSometimes you gotta do a little dirt\nComing from where I'm from, I'm from\n\nWasn't really looking guess I found it\nFive foot three, light brown skin\nComing from the university\nNice style, looking kinda lovely\nDidn't know she had much game\nDown to ride out, even take the train\nEven took her to a poker game\nShe's top notch from fried chicken to sushi\n\nTried to be good; tried to treat you like a lady\nTried to be a friend; turned out that you were shady\n\nSometimes it gets lonely\nComing from where I'm from, I'm from\nThings ain't what they seem to be\nComing from where I'm from, I'm from\nSometimes you get a little angry\nComing from where I'm from, I'm from\nSometimes you get the best of me\nComing from where I'm from, I'm from\n\nWell, tried to be good (I tried), wanted nothing but to love somebody\nDidn't wanna die young, steady hustling trying to feed my family\nToo scared to have kids and do like daddy did, cause I'm so scared of failing\nSometimes it gets hard, coming from where I'm from\n\nComing from where I'm from, I'm from\nSometimes you gotta moan\nComing from where I'm from, I'm from\nSometimes you gotta cry a little bit louder\nComing from where I'm from, I'm from\nSometimes you gotta fight the pain\nComing from where I'm from, I'm from\nSometimes you gotta walk alone\nComing from where I'm from, I'm from\nSometimes you get a little worried\nComing from where I'm from, I'm from\nSometimes you get lost outta touch\nComing from where I'm from, I'm from\nSometimes I think I pray a little bit too much\nComing from where I'm from, I'm from\nSometimes I get a little scared\nComing from where I'm from, I'm from\nSometimes I get a little scared\nComing from where I'm from, I'm from\nSometimes \nComing from where I'm from, I'm from\nComing from where I'm from, I'm from",
