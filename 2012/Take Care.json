 "lyrics": "I know you've been hurt by someone else\nI can tell by the way you carry yourself\nIf you let me, here's what I'll do\nI'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)\nI've loved and I've lost\n\nI've asked about you and they told me things\nBut my mind didn't change and I still feel the same\nWhat's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed\nI've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know\nThey won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real\n'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal\nAnd you can't sleep thinking that he lies still\nSo you cry still, \ntears all in the pillowcase\nBig girls all get a little taste, ah\nPushing me away so I give her space, ah\nDealing with a heart that I didn't break\nI'll be there for you, I will care for you\nI keep thinking you just don't know\nTryna run from that, say you done with that\nOn your face, girl, it just don't show\nWhen you're ready, just say you're ready\nWhen all the baggage just ain't as heavy\nAnd the party's over, just don't forget me\nWe'll change the pace and we'll just go slow\nYou won't ever have to worry\nYou won't ever have to hide\nAnd you've seen all my mistakes\nSo look me in my eyes\n[Chorus: Rihanna & \nDrake\n]\n'Cause if you let me\nHere's what I'll do\nI'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)\nI've loved and I've lost\n(\nYeah\n)\n\nIt's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to\nCan't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to\n'Cause you don't say you love me\nTo your friends when they ask you\nEven though we both know that you do, you do\nOne time, been in love one time\nYou and all your girls in the club one time\nAll so convinced that you're following your heart\n'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes\nWe all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed\nI've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know\nYou hate being alone, well you ain't the only one\nYou hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one\nYou love your friends, but somebody should've told you some\nTo save you, instead, they say\n\nDon't tell me, I don't care\nIf you hurt, I don't tell you\nYou don't care, if you're true\nDon't tell me, I don't care\nIf you hurt, I don't tell you\nYou don't care, if you're true\n\nI know you've been hurt by someone else\nI can tell by the way you carry yourself\nIf you let me, here's what I'll do\nI'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)\nI've loved and I've lost",
