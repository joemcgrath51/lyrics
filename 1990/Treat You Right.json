Hey, hey\nBut strange how your friends\nCan sometimes let you fall down\nHey, hey, hey...\n\nBut you and everyone in the world can see\nThat I'm for real, honey\nSee, I don't know how to fool your heart\nI just know what I know and what I know is...\n\nI will treat you right\n'Cause little darlin', you've got to be mine\nI see your love light, oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nWe'll have a beautiful time\nAll night\nI think about you, yeah, you're so fine\nAnd it just might work out (work out) work, work\nIf I treat you right\nMy, my, my, my baby\n\nI want to keep you close to the heart\nWhat can I say? Hey, hey\nSo I know, you will never ever, never go far\n'Cause I can feel if it's real\n\nAnd though your friends say they still doubt me\nThey don't know of the you I see\nAnd I don't know how to do you wrong\nI just know what I know and what I know is\n\nI will treat you right\nOoh, baby, you've got to be mine\nI see your love light\nAnd I know that, and I that we gon' have a beautiful time\nAll night\nI think about you, yes I do, you're so fine\nAnd it just might work out (work out) work, work\nIf I treat you right\nYeah\n\nYou and everyone in the world can see\nThat I'm for real, honey, yeah\nSee, I don't know how to fool your heart\nI just know what I know and what I know is...\n\nI will treat you right\nYeah, you've got to be mine\nI'll treat you right, if I get you back\nI'll treat you right, if I get you right back\nI'll treat you right, if I get you back\nBeautiful time, we gon' have it\nAll night, that's right\nI think about you, you're so fine\nAnd it just might work out (work out) work, work\nIf I treat you right\nKeep it steady\nHey, hey hey (Treat you right)\nSteady, keep it steady, keep it steady\nHey, hey hey (Treat you right)\nMy, my, my, my baby\nI'll treat you right, if I get you back\nI'll treat you right, if I get you right back\nI'll treat you right, if I get you back\n(Got to be mine)\nI'll treat you right, if I get you back\nI'll treat you right, if I get you right back\nI'll treat you right, if I get you back\n(Beautiful time)\nI'll treat you right, and I'll get you back\nI'll treat you right, and I'll get you right back\nI'll treat you right, and I'll get you back\n(You're so fine)\nAnd it just might work out (work out) work, work\nIf I treat you right\nMy, my, my, my, my, my...
