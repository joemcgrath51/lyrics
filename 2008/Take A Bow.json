(Ooh, oh)\n\nAnd don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not (Mmm)\nBaby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught\n\nBut you put on quite a show (Ooh, oh)\nReally had me going\nBut now it's time to go (Ooh, oh)\nCurtain's finally closing\nThat was quite a show (Ooh, oh)\nVery entertaining\nBut it's over now (But it's over now)\nGo on and take a bow\n\nOh, and the award for the best liar goes to you (Goes to you)\nFor making me believe\nThat you could be faithful to me\nLet's hear your speech, oh\nHow 'bout a round of applause?\nA standing ovation\n\nBut you put on quite a show (Ooh, oh)\nReally had me going\nNow it's time to go (Ooh, oh)\nCurtain's finally closing\nThat was quite a show (Ooh, oh)\nVery entertaining\nBut it's over now (But it's over now)\nGo on and take a bow\nBut it's over now",
