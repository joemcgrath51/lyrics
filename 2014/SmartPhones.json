 "lyrics": "She picks up the phone\nIn my head I know I'm wrong\nI just want to know what she's heard\nI'm pacing back and forth, cause I know that I've been caught\nTrying to think of the perfect words\n\nSo I can come to her and lie right to her face\nI don't know what I'm gonna say\nBut I know that I'm gonna say\nWhatever it takes\nI'ma run to her and lie right to her face\nI don't know what I'm gonna say\nBut I know that I'm gonna say\nWhatever it takes\nTime is not on our side\n'Cause she's waving goodbye goodbye\nShe's waving goodbye goodbye\nSmartphones, dumb shit\n\nNever knew I call so if she heard it all\nI'm all out of luck tonight\nI can say it was a joke but who am I kidding she ain't slow\nOnly way to make it right\n\nIs if I can come to her and lie right to her face\nI don't know what I'm gonna say\nBut I know that I'm gonna say\nWhatever it takes\nI'ma run to her and lie right to her face\nI don't know what I'm gonna say\nBut I know that I'm gonna say\nWhatever it takes\nOh gonna tell you whatever it takes\nWhatever it takes, whatever it takes\nWhatever it takes, take\nWhatever it takes\nOh girl\nSmartphones, dumb shit\n\nDon't you wave goodbye goodbye, smartphones, dumb shit\nDon't you wave goodbye goodbye smartphones, dumb shit\nAw man I got to think of something\nI'm about to lose it all\nI swear that shit really didn't mean nothing\nIt all started with a pocket call\n\nSo I'ma run to her and lie right to her face\nI don't know what I'm gonna say, yeah\nBut I know that I'm gonna say\nWhatever it takes\nI'ma run to her and lie right to her face\nI don't know what I'm gonna say\nBut I know that I'm gonna say\nI'm gonna say whatever it takes\nTime is not on our side\n'Cause she's waving goodbye goodbye\nShe's waving goodbye goodbye\nSmartphones, dumb shit\nSmartphones, dumb shit\nSmartphones, dumb shit",
