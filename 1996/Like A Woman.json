 "lyrics": "I don't know, what I do to you\nBut I find myself at the East river, waiting to meet with you\nLate at night, I keep dreaming of you\nWe're making love, on the sofa, that belongs to you\nWe fly higher than kites, when we're face to face\nSearching for time, alone, in this here violent place\nWe don't know who we are, or why we've met\nThat is strangely good, in some sort of freakish way\nThe things we'll do, will make you feel like a woman\nFalling in love, with a man she doesn't even know\nThe words we'll say, will send your mind on a journey\nLooking for self-understanding, of the things we've done\nCatch your breath; your heart beats too fast\nYou feel my presence, in your arms, will not last\nI have an urge; I must kiss your hand\nThe first scent of this woman's fragrance, lies deep in my head\nSo we slit our wrists, and we join our blood\nTo symbolise, some type of, crazy oath\nSometimes it feels so wrong, but it could be good enough\nTo sacrifice our freedom for each other's hearts\nThe things we'll do, will make you feel like a woman\nFalling in love, with a man she doesn't even know\nThe words we'll say, will send your mind on a journey\nLooking for self-understanding, of the things we've done\nThe things we'll do, will make you feel like a woman\nFalling in love, with a man she doesn't even know\nThe words we'll say, will send your mind on a journey\nLooking for self-understanding, of the things we've done\nThe things we'll do, will make you feel like a woman\nFalling in love, with a man she doesn't even know\nThe words we'll say, will send your mind on a journey\nLooking for self-understanding, of the things we've done",
