 "lyrics": "We don't believe you 'cause we the people\nAre still here in the rear, ayo, we don't need you\nYou in the killing-off-good-young-nigga mood\nWhen we get hungry we eat the same fucking food\nThe ramen noodle\nYour simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju\nThe irony is that this bad bitch in my lap\nShe don't love me, she make money, she don't study that\nShe gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back\nShe gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that\nThe doors have signs with, don't try to rhyme with\nVH1 has a show that you can waste your time with\nGuilty pleasures take the edge off reality\nAnd for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically\nThe OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas\nThe IRS piranha see a nigga gettin' commas\nNiggas in the hood living in a fishbowl\nGentrify here, now it's not a shit hole\nTrendsetter, I know, my shit's cold\nAin't settling because I ain't so bold but ay\n\nAll you Black folks, you must go\nAll you Mexicans, you must go\nAnd all you poor folks, you must go\nMuslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways\nSo all you bad folks, you must go\n\nThe fog and the smog of news media that logs\nFalse narratives of Gods that came up against the odds\nWe're not just nigga rappers with the bars\nIt's kismet that we're cosmic with the stars\n\nYou bastards overlooking street art\nBetter yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts\nSo motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians\nFuck y'all know about true competition?\nThat's like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin'\nThe only one who's hitting are the ones that's currently spittin'\nWe got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten\nDreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division\nBoy, I tell you that's vision\nLike Tony Romo when he hitting Witten\nThe Tribe be the best in they division\nShaheed Muhammad cut it with precision\nWho can come back years later, still hit the shot?\nStill them tryna move we off the fucking block\nBabylon, bloodclaat\nTwo pon yuh headtop\n\nAll you Black folks, you must go\nAll you Mexicans, you must go\nAnd all you poor folks, you must go\nMuslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways\nSo all you bad folks, you must go",
