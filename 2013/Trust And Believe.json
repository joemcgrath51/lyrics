 "lyrics": "When we were together, I held you down\nI gave you all of me, but look at us now\nThinking of all your excuses, but they don't add up\nNow it's so easy to see you don't deserve my love\n\nYou pushed me far, you brought me through it\nYou had my heart, but then you blew it\nAnd I'm so over you, go get lost (Get lost)\nBoy, who do you think that you are?\n\nTrust and believe me, you're gonna need me\nTrust and believe me, she'll never be me\nAnd I'm so over you\nGo get lost (Go get lost)\nBoy, I don't know who you think that you are\n\nYou look so foolish\nWith my best friend\nAnd she ain't no better than you\nShe's a three, I'm a ten\nSo why are you calling my phone?\nYou ain't got nothing I want\nThought we were really in love\nBut that was all a front\n\nYou pushed me far, you brought me through it\nYou had my heart, but then you blew it, oh\nAnd I'm so over you, go get lost (Get lost)\nBoy, who do you think that you are?\n\nTrust and believe me, you're gonna need me\nTrust and believe me, she'll never be me\nAnd I'm so over you\nGo get lost (Go get lost)\nBoy, I don't know who you think that you are\n\nHow did you try to clean it up\nBoy, please just stop it now (Stop it now)\nDon't make a sound\n\n'Cause you pushed me far, you brought me to this\nYou had my heart, but then you blew it, oh\nAnd I'm so over you, go get lost (Go get lost)\nBoy, who do you think that you are?\n\nBelieve me, you're gonna need me (You're gonna need me)\nTrust and believe me (Believe me), she'll never be me\nAnd I'm so over you (Over you)\nGo get lost (Go get lost)\nBoy, I don't know who you think you are\n\nI'm so over you\nGo get lost\nWho do you think that you are?",
