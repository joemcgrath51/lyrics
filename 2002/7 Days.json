No\nDidn't she mind? I don't think so\nWas it for real? Damn sure\nWhat was the deal? A pretty girl, age 24\nSo was she keen? She couldn't wait\nCinnamon queen? Let me update\nWhat did she say?\nShe said she'd, \"Love to rendezvous\"\nShe asked me, \"What we were gonna do?\"\nSaid we'd start with a bottle of Moet for two\n\nMonday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday\nI met this girl on Monday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday\n\nNine was the time\n'Cause I'll be getting mine\nAnd she was looking fine\nSmooth talker\nShe told me\nShe'd love to unfold me all night long\nOoh, I loved the way she kicked it\nFrom the front to back she flipped it\n(Back she flipped it, the way she kicked it)\nAnd I oh-oh I yeah\nHope that she'd care\n'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there (Oh yeah)\n\nI'm not a man to play around, baby (Oh yeah)\n'Cause a one night stand isn't really fair\nFrom the first impression girl, hmm, you don't seem to be like that\n'Cause there's no need to chat 'for there'll be plenty time for that\nFrom the subway to my home\nEndless ringing off my phone\nWhen you feeling all alone\nAll you gotta do\nIs just call me, call me\n\nMonday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday\nI met this girl on Monday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday\n\n(Break it down, break it down)\nSince I met this special lady\nOoh yeah\nI can't get her off my mind\nShe's one of a kind\nAnd I ain't about to deny it\nIt's a special kind of thing\nWith you, oh\n\nMonday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday\nI met this girl on Monday\nTook her for a drink on Tuesday\nWe were making love by Wednesday\nAnd on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday\n(Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, Sunday)",
