Shorty, when you party with me\nWe goin' way past quarter to three\n(I say hands up!) I'm good in the VIP\nI got my hammer right here with me\n(I say hands up!) You know when you party with crooks\nYou gotta learn to respect the jux\n(I say hands up!) Everything ain't cool as the fame\nAnd this shit ain't as sweet as it looks (I say hands up!)\nYou know I'm puttin' something on me\nRight before I leave outta the car (We came to party)\nYou go tough talkin' at me\nYou gon' leave out the club wit a scar (We came to party)\nWe pop bottles like it's all free\n'Fore I leave, I'mma buy out the bar (We came to party)\nYou gon' order whatchu want, it's on me\nI'm a G, take a look at a star (We came to party)\n\nIt feels so good to live sucka free\nI'm soakin' it all up while your girl's suckin' me\nIt mean the world to her, it's nuttin' but a nut to me\nLook miss, get a grip or let a mothafucker be\nI'm a rap star, who 'posed to be ridin' around in that car\nTwo in the front, in the back got the plasma\nThis ain't a free ride, you gotta have the gas ma\nI wouldn't buy a chick a pump that got asthma\nAnd I'm busy so I move a bit faster\nYou can't tell me yes if I don't ask ya, huh\nI'm a bastard, damn near chauvinist, hand over the plastic\nCause they wanna see ya man go in the casket\nRule number one: keep ya gun or get ya ass hit\nAnd that's it, lights off and ya body stiff\nBy the same niggas you used to party with\n\n\nYea\nI cruise through the strip, 22's on the whip, new Ruger on the hip\nThousand dollar outfit, never stooge never slip\nFollow rules or get whipped, nigga move or get hit\nI don't care who's on the strip\nIt ain't only the Ferrari now, the jewels got 'em sick\nNow it's 2006, I need a new bottom miss\nIt's a'ight, they can talk, I'm amused by the pricks\nI'm the news out the bricks, nigga, who's hot as this?\nI bet the mansion and the swimming pool got 'em pissed\nI ain't a cuddler, I fuck the drool outta chick\nMy niggas ice-grill, but it ain't the same\nThey don't see the faces, they just see the chains like\nOOH when ya get 'em, they don't know you with me\nThey probably think the bouncers at the front door frisk me\nThis regular shit, the everyday mentality\nThey charged up, don't make me put in the battery\n\nPut 'em up\nPut 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up\nPut 'em up\nPut 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up",
