Is the reason I must be myself\nWhat else? Well fame hasn't got me\nSouped up selling out, sloppy or poppy\nThere so much to live for, therefore\nHere's more from a woman\nAll women keep the rumors to yourself\nThe over blown home grown not known\nFools who never shown proof let alone own\nA lot of props or a hip hip pop chart\nNotch on your clock is my spot\nNow who got the Mott\u2019s?\nWhy you little played out\nAa-choo!\nI'm allergic to wack crews\nThe La, the ti, the fah\nThe queen is up\nThrowing salt that you never seen before\nHow dare those who talk we can't have them\nSome make me wanna go out with the bat and a magnum\nBut a wise, civilized and growing higher\nJudgments from the Queen punishment is the fire\nI'm here to make these fools out of liars\nYou must learn step and respect the sire, face the fire\nLatifah had it up to here the frauds felling fear, fear\nThe sound is playing like a \nQ-tip\n digging your ear ear\nMama Zula stands for positivity, knowledge and grace\nI never run my piece Damn!
