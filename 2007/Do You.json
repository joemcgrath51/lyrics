 "lyrics": "Maybe this decision was a mistake\nYou probably don't care what I have to say\nBut it's been heavy on my mind for months now\nGuess I'm trying to clear some mental space\nI would love to talk to you in person\nBut I understand why that can't be\nI'll leave you alone for good, I promise\nIf you answer this one question for me\n\nI just wonder\nDo you ever\nThink of me anymore\nDo you?\n\nFirst off, let me say \"congratulations\"\nHeard that you just had a baby girl\nIf she looks anything like her mother\nShe's the prettiest thing in the world\nSwear that I'm not trying to start no trouble\nTell your fiance he can relax\nI'll leave you alone for good, I promise\nThere's a question I just got to ask\n\nI just wonder\nDo you ever\nThink of me anymore\nDo you?\n\nI know what we have is dead and gone\nToo many times I made you cry\nAnd I don't mean to interrupt your life\nI just wonder, do I ever cross your mind?\n\nI just wonder\nDo you ever\nThink of me anymore\nDo you?\nI just wonder\nDo you ever\nThink of me anymore\nDo you?\nI just wonder\nDo you ever\nThink of me anymore\nDo you?\nI just wonder\nDo you ever\nThink of me anymore\nDo you?",
