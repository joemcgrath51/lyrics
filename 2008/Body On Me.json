I need to know your name\nYou givin me the eye-eye, I'm givin you the same\nIt just hit me right now, what we should do today\nGo tell your friends bye-bye and let's go hop a plane\nIt's no mistaken, the attraction's ironic\nI wanna make you someone more than just a bone in my closet\nI wanna win that, type of relationship\nWhere you gon' wanna come hang when your man done tripped\nYou say you short this month and you're late on your rent\nHe took your car, what you mean? Hold this\nYea-yayyy, sing, whoahhhh\nYou see, lil' mama outta control, and I'm just sayin\n[Chorus: Akon & \nAshanti\n]\nThe way that you're walkin, the way that you're talkin' - talkin\nYou're the one I wanna spend this night with\nTryna get in them drawers and bang it out 'til the mornin' - the morning\n(\nAh\n) I can already tell you want it\nCause you're shakin it all for me, givin it all to me\nRubbin' that \nbody on me\nKeep on shakin it all for me, givin it all to me\nRubbin' that \nbody on me\n\n(I'm lovin' that!)\nShorty movin' closer, and closer\nAnd slower, and lower, yeah\nI think she know she makin' me hard\nGot every man in the building like, \"Oh my God\"\nShe, slicker than lodi-dodi, she work her body body\nWhen you done hurr at the party, meet me down there in the lobby\nAnd I'll be waitin' on ya, ain't no debatin on ya\nI got a seat for ya, we can let the top back and go\nWe don't have to stop girl, no\nI got a lil' somethin I wanna show\nBelieve me, you're strong\nLil' mama please don't make me wait too long (Yea-yay)\n[Chorus: Akon & \nAshanti\n]\nThe way that you're walkin, the way that you're talkin' - talkin\nYou're the one I wanna spend this night with\nTryna get in them drawers and bang it out 'til the mornin' - the morning\n(\nAh\n) I can already tell you want it\nCause you're shakin' it all for me, givin it all to me\nRubbin' that \nbody on me\nKeep on shakin' it all for me, givin it all to me\nRubbin' that \nbody on me\n\nNow I see you're lookin' at my body, babe\nAnd now you wanna come and put it on me\nIf I gave it to you could you promise me\nThat you could make it feel like it never did\nCause I see you (I see you) and you see me (You see me)\nNow if I please you (I please you) could you please me\n(You please me)\nNow I ain't the one in no relationship\nAnd I ain't tryna be the other chick\nI know you want it\n[Chorus: Akon & \nAshanti\n]\nThe way that you're walkin, the way that you're talkin' - talkin\nYou're the one I wanna spend this night with\nTryna get in them drawers and bang it out 'til the mornin' - the morning\n(\nAh\n) I can already tell you want it\nCause you're shakin' it all for me, givin it all to me\nRubbin' that \nbody on me\nKeep on shakin' it all for me, givin it all to me\nRubbin' that \nbody on me",
