 "lyrics": "Come on\nNatalie La Rose\n\nI wanna rock with somebody\nI wanna take shots with somebody\nI wanna leave with somebody\nAnd we ain't gonna tell nobody, we ain't gonna tell nobody\n\nWalk in, everybody knows what's good\nBut some gonna hate, what's new?\nWe just do our thing, no time to waste\nAlways play it cool\n\nAnd at the end of the night when the lights go out\nWill we turn down? Oh no we won't\n(We ain't never turnin' down, we ain't never turnin' down)\nAnd when they try to make us leave\nWe turn and say we never going home\n(And you know just what I wanna do)\n\nI wanna rock with somebody\nI wanna take shots with somebody\nI wanna leave with somebody\nAnd we ain't gotta tell nobody, we ain't gotta tell nobody\n\nWalk in, everybody know what's good\nWe're our only plug\nBring us everything we think we need\nTonight is goin' up\nTonight is goin' up\n\nAnd at the end of the night when the lights go out\nWill we turn down? Oh no we won't\n(We ain't never turnin' down, we ain't never turnin' down)\nAnd when they try to make us leave\nWe turn and say we never going home\n(And you know just what I wanna do)\n\nI wanna rock with somebody\nI wanna take shots with somebody\nI wanna leave with somebody\nAnd we ain't gotta tell nobody, we ain't gotta tell nobody\n\nIn the club like what\nWe be in the party in the club like what\nAnd the club like\nWe be in the city going dumb like what\nIn the club like what\nWe be in the party in the club like what\nWe be in the city going dumb like what\nWe be in the party in the club like what\n\nAnd at the end of the night when the lights go out\nWill we turn down? Oh no we won't\n(We ain't never turnin' down, we ain't never turnin' down)\nAnd when they try to make us leave\nWe turn and say we never going home\n(And you know just what I wanna do)\n\nI wanna rock with somebody\nI wanna take shots with somebody\nI wanna leave with somebody\nAnd we ain't gotta tell nobody, we ain't gotta tell nobody",
