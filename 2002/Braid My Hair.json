 "lyrics": "When you look at me, I know you see\nA 16-year-old, getting his dough\nBack and fourth to the studios\nHopping out limousines, rocking the latest jeans\nJordan's, fresh\nT-Shirt, new\nAnd even though these things are true\nIt's hard work and sometimes I just want to go home\nAnd tell my girl...\n\nBraid my hair\nC'mon and braid my hair\nBack in my hood, feeling good\nNo worries or no cares\nBaby, use your hands\nTo make me feel alright\nAnd take away the stress and drama in my life\nWhile you braid my hair...\n\nYou may think that I'm complaining\nBut that's not the case, all I'm saying\nIs my body gets weak, my mind gets tired\nI need sleep, but I got to keep\nTravelling on the road\nDoing these shows\nNew York to Cali\nDallas to Philly\nIt's the rules of the game, that I chose to play\nBut sometimes I want to say\nBaby won't you...\n\nBraid my hair\nC'mon and braid my hair\nBack in my hood, feeling good\nNo worries or no cares\nBaby, use your hands\nTo make me feel alright\nAnd take away the stress and drama in my life\nWhile you braid my hair...\n\nSit me down like you love me\nDo it anyway you want\nBaby take it slowly\nFront to back, side to side, criss cross\nGet creative with it girl, do your thing\nPut it down like you love me\nLet your fingers do the walking and your lips do the talking\nIn my ear\nTell me what I want to hear\nI swear\nI can't wait for you to braid my hair...\n\nC'mon and braid my hair\nBack in my hood, feeling good\nNo worries or no cares\nBaby, use your hands\nTo make me feel alright\nAnd take away the stress and drama in my life\nWhile you braid my hair...\nDo what you want to do\nBaby its up to you\nSit me between your legs\nGirl won't you braid my hair\nBaby make me feel alright\nAnd make it last all night\nAnd take away the stress and drama in my life\nWon't you braid my hair...\n\nC'mon and braid my hair\nBack in my hood, feeling good\nNo worries or no cares\nBaby, use your hands\nTo make me feel alright\nAnd take away the stress and drama in my life\nWhile you braid my hair...",
