 "lyrics": "Back when I was a child\nBefore life removed all the innocence\nMy father would lift me high\nAnd dance with my mother and me\nAnd then\nSpin me around 'till I fell asleep\nThen up the stairs he would carry me\nAnd I knew for sure\nI was loved\nIf I could get another chance\nAnother walk\nAnother dance with him\nI'd play a song that would never ever end\nHow I'd love love love\nTo dance with my father again\nWhen I and my mother\nWould disagree\nTo get my way I would run\nFrom her to him\nHe'd make me laugh just to comfort me\nYeah yeah\nThen finally make me do\nJust what my mama said\nLater that night when I was asleep\nHe left a dollar under my sheet\nNever dreamed that he\nWould be gone from me\nIf I could steal one final glance\nOne final step\nOne final dance with him\nI'd play a song that would never ever end\nCause I'd love love love to\nDance with my father again\nSometimes I'd listen outside her door\nAnd I'd hear how mama would cry for him\nI'd pray for her even more than me\nI'd pray for her even more than me\nI know I'm praying for much to much\nBut could you send her\nThe only man she loved\nI know you don't do it usually\nBut Dear Lord\nShe's dying to dance with my father again\nEvery night I fall asleep\nAnd this is all I ever dream",
