 "lyrics": "It's been five months since you went away\nYou left without a word and nothing to say (Nothing to say)\nWhen I was the one who gave you my heart and soul\nBut it wasn't good enough for you, no\nSo I asked God\n\nGod send me an angel from the heavens above\nSend me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love\n'Cause all I do is cry (Is cry)\nGod send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes\n\nAnd I know it might sound crazy\nBut after all that, I still love you\nYou wanna come back in my life\nBut now there's something I have to do\nI have to tell the one that I once adored\nThat they can't have my love no more\n'Cause my heart can't take no more lies\nAnd my eyes are all out of cries\nSo, God\n\nGod send me an angel from the heavens above\nSend me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love\n'Cause all I do is cry (All I do is cry)\nGod send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes\n(Send me an angel)\n\nNow you had me on my knees\nBegging God please to send you back to me\nI couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep\nYou made me feel like I could not breathe\nNow all I wanted to do was to feel your touch\nAnd give you all my love (give you all my love)\nBut you took my love for granted\nWant my lovin' now, but you can't have it\nSo, God\n\nGod send me an angel (Send me an angel)\nFrom the heavens above\nSend me an angel to heal my broken heart\nFrom being in love\nCause all I do is cry\nGod send me an angel\nTo wipe the tears from my eyes\nOh God, send me (God send me an angel)\nAn angel (Wipe the tears from my eyes)\nOh baby\nSend me an angel from the heavens above\nSend me an angel (God send me an angel)\nFrom being in love (Send me an angel)\nOh God, send me an angel\nSend me an angel (Send me an angel)\nOoohhhh",
