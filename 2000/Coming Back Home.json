 "lyrics": "BEBE:\nTook some time to come around\nRealize how I let you down\nBeen too late for sorry now\nMy pride got in the way\nYes it did\nJOE:\nI thought I had it all figured out\nI needed time away to work it out\nAnd now that I've learned what it's all about\nAnd all I need is you in my life\nChorus:\nSo I'm coming back home\nHome, where love is waiting for me\nBeen gone much too long\nThis is where I want to be\nSo I'm coming home\nComing home\nCuz home is where I belong\nBRIAN MCKNIGHT:\nSomehow I lost my way\nMistakes I made I have to pay\nIt hurts to know still today\nThat I wasted so much time\nBEBE:\nAnd after all is said and done\nThere's more to life than having fun\nAin't no doubt, you're the one\nAnd all I need is you in my life\nChorus\nJust to be in your arms is like heaven to me\nYour love, your love is all that I need\nSo I'm coming back home\nAnd I hope you forgive all my wrong\nSo I'm coming home, coming home\nCuz home is where I belong\nChorus",
