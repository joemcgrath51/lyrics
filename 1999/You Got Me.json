Think the Thought went home and forgot?\nTime passed, we back in Philly, now she up in my spot\nTellin' me the things I'm tellin' her is makin' her hot\nStarted buildin' with her constantly 'round-the-clock\nNow she in my world like hip-hop, and keep tellin' me\u2026\n\nIf you were worried 'bout where\nI been or who I saw or\nWhat club I went to with my homies\nBaby, don't worry, you know that you got me\n\nYo, I'm the type that's always catchin' a flight\nAnd sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night\nAnd that's when she flip and get on some old\u2026\nAnother lonely night\nSeem like I'm on the side, you only lovin' your mic\nI know you gotta get that paper, daddy, keep that shit tight\nBut, yo, I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me?\nWhile politickin' with my sister from New York City\nShe said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty\u2014psych\nI'm playin', boo, you know it's just with you I'm stayin', boo\nAnd when cats be poppin' game, I don't hear what they sayin', boo\nWhen you out there in the world, I'm still your girl\nWith all my classes, I don't have the time for life's thrills\nSo when you sweatin' on stage, think of me when you rhyme\nAnd don't be listenin' to your homies, they be leadin' you blind\nYeah, so what you sayin'? I can trust you?\nIs you crazy?! You my king, for real\nBut sometimes relationships get ill, no doubt...\n\nIf you were worried 'bout where\nI been or who I saw or\nWhat club I went to with my homies\nBaby, don't worry, you know that you got me\n\nThat snake could be that chick and that rat could be that cool cat\nThat's whisperin', \"She tryin' to play you for the fool, Black\"\nIf something's on your chest, then let it be known\nSee, I'm not your every-five-minutes-all-on-the-phone\nAnd on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact\nThat people bite back and fracture what's intact\nAnd they'll forever be, I ain't on some \"Oh, I'm a celebrity!\"\nI deal with the real, so if it's artificial, let it be\nI've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds\nListenin' to they squads and listenin' to girlfriends\nThat's exactly the point where they whole world ends\nLies come in, that's where that drama begins, and she like\u2026\n\nIf you were worried 'bout where\nI been or who I saw or\nWhat club I went to with my homies\nBaby, don't worry, you know that you got me\nIf you were worried 'bout where\nI been or who I saw or...",
