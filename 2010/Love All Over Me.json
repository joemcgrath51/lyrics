 "lyrics": "Must not have been paying attention\nI stepped right on in it\nDidn't even notice how deep I was\nI went from the ground to the top of the cloud\nAnd now as I look down\nI see where I fell into your arms\n\nNow I got love all over me\nBaby, you touch every part of me\nOoh, I got love all over me\nAnd I don't wanna get it off\nI'm completely covered up in your love\n\nEven my skin is changing\nI'm feelin' warmer\nNo more icy blue hearts for me\nYou put the color back in my life\nAnd now where there was black and white\nYou're becoming iridescent\n\nAnd I got love all over me\nBaby, you touch every part of me\nOh, I, I got love all over me\nAnd I don't wanna get it off\nI'm completely covered up in your love\n\nBefore your love, baby, I was muddy\nSo deep with pain 'til you took it from me\nYou showered me with a new beginning, now I'm clean\nTook me by surprise when you ran up on me\nI came to life, baby, in that moment\nYou put your hands on my heart\nAnd baby, now it beats\n\nNow I got love all over me\nAnd baby, you touch every part of me\nOoh, I got love all over me\nAnd I don't wanna get it off\nI'm completely covered up in your love\nIn your love, in your love\n\nAnd I don't wanna get it off\nI'm completely covered in your love\nOh, I, in your love",
