 "lyrics": "Yo, I ain't seen you in a minute\nBut I got something to tell you\nListen\n\nSee, the thing about you that caught my eye\nIs the same thing that makes me change my mind\nKind of hard to explain, but girl, I'll try\nYou need to sit down, this may take a while\nSee this girl, she sort of looks just like you\nShe even smiles just the way you do\nSo innocent she seemed, but I was fooled\nI'm reminded when I look at you\n\nYou remind me of a girl, that I once knew\nSee her face whenever I, I look at you\nYou won't believe all of the things she put me through\nThis is why I just can't get with you\n\nThought that she was the one for me\nTil I found out she was on her creep\nOoh, she was sexing everyone, but me\nThis is why we could never be\n\nYou remind me of a girl, that I once knew\nSee her face whenever I, I look at you\nYou won't believe all of the things she put me through\nThis is why I just can't get with you\n\nI know it's so unfair to you (it's so unfair)\nThat I relate her ignorance to you\nWish I knew\nWish I knew how to separate the two\nYou remind me (you remind me)\n\nWhoa whoa oh oh oh oh\nYou remind me of a girl that I once knew\nSee her face whenever I, I look at you\nYou won't believe all of the things she put me through\nThis is why I just can't get with you, (gotta let you go)\nYou remind me of a girl that I once knew\nSee her face whenever I, I look at you\nYou won't believe all of the things she put me through (all the shit she put me through)\nThis is why I just can't get with you, no no\nYou remind me of a girl that I once knew\nSee her face whenever I, I look at you\nYou won't believe all of the things she put me through\nThis is why I just can't get with you\nYou remind me of a girl that I once knew\nSee her face whenever I, I look at you\nYou won't believe all of the things she put me through\nThis is why I just can't get with you\nYou remind me of a girl that I once knew\nSee her face whenever I, I look at you\nYou won't believe all of the things she put me through\nThis is why I just can't get with you\n\nYou remind me of a girl that I once knew\nSee her face whenever I, I look at you\nWouldn't believe all of the things she put me through\nThis is why I just can't get with you",
