over\nHangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (Hangover)\nHangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (Hangover)\nParty's over, it ain't over\nCannot find a single piece of me, game over\n\nHangover\nHangover\nHangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over\nHangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (Hangover)\nHangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over\nCannot find a single piece of me, game over\n\nDrink 'til you're drunk\nSmoke like a broke stove\nDon't quit, take flight\nI can't remember last night\nIt's aight, this the life of a superstar\nSci-fi with that boy trooping hard\n, \ncouping cars\nSnoop be hard in the paint\nDrink another cup until I fall flat\nAll lead and then some\n1-5-1, done dilly\nReally for sure that\nI'm throw back intoxicated\nChange over, game over, hangover, faded\n\nBody Shit Miss\n\ub300\uccb4 \uc5b4\ub514 \uc788\uc73c\n\uaf80\uaf2c\ub9ac \ubabb \ucc3e\uaca0\uc5b4\nEeny, meeny, miny, moe catch a lady by the toe\n\uc548 \uc608\uc058\uba74 \uc608\ubed0 \ubcf4\uc77c \ub54c\uae4c\uc9c0 \ube60\ub77c\uc090\ub9ac\ubf40\n\nDrink it up and get sick\nBottom's up, get wasted\nPour it up, drink it up, live it up, give it up\nOh my God, dammit, there's the fucking limit\nPour it up, drink it up, live it up, give it up\n(\ubc1b\uc73c\uc2dc\uc624)\nBut I can't stop\nMaking bottles pop until the wheels fall off\n(\ubc1b\uc73c\uc2dc\uc624)\nAnd I can't quit\nI wake up in the morning, do the same shit\nWake up in the morning, do the same shit\n\nHangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (Hangover)\nHangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (Hangover)\nParty's over, it ain't over\nTry to make a bad memory over and over\nHangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (Hangover)\nHangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (Hangover)\nParty's over, it ain't over\nCannot find a single piece of me, game over\n\nHangover\nHangover\nHangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over\nHangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (Hangover)\nHangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over\nCannot find a single piece of me, game over\n\nWaking and baking, shaking the fleas\nCaking and baking, raking the cheese\nEarly in the morning in the bathroom on my knees\nTipping and dripping, flipping the flow\nWhipping and dripping a drink on the floor\nThis is the only way that I was taught a long time ago\nSeoul, Korea, you'll see a G-a like me-a\nNever would there ever be another like he-a\nG-A-N-G-S-T-A, nothing left to say\nI done smoked my whole day\n\n\ubca0\uc774\ube44 \ub098\ub97c \uc2dc\ud5d8\ud574, \uc5b4\uc11c \ub098\ub97c \uc2dc\ud5d8\ud574\n\uac70\uc2dc\uae30\uac00 \uac70\uc2dc\uae30\ud558\ub2c8 \uac70\uc2dc\uae30\ud558\uace0
