Oohh yeahh\nGirl I know what you been needing;\nYour body needs sexual heeling\nAnd I'm here; I can make it right if you just let me\nDon't leave\u2026yeah\u2026\nChorus\n:\nListen baby;\nBaby when it's all said and done\nYou and me will be as one\nWe can lay in love;\nNo no no no rushing, rushing\nAnd girl I'm putting this on everything;\nYou ain't gotta leave\u2026\nChorus\n:\nBaby I can make it right;\nJust one night;\nLet me lay you down\nI can make it, make it\nGirl, I'm glad you want it;\nSo lay your body down\nBaby you can have it;\nLet's make it right\nBaby I can a make it right;\nJust one night;\nLet me lay you down\nI can make it make it\nLet me lay you down\nI can make it make it\u2026",
