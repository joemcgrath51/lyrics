 "lyrics": "Woop, turn the lights on\nOh woah, oh woah\n\nWe share something so common, but still so rare\nAnd I\u2019m in awe, never been here before\nSo high, we\u2019re still climbing, even here inside these walls\nBreaking each others hearts and we don\u2019t care 'cause we\u2019re so\n\nIn too deep, can\u2019t think about giving it up\nBut I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack\nIt\u2019s killing me, swear I never cried so much\n'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad\nThe worst pain that I ever had\nOh woah, never knew love, oh woah\nWould hurt this fucking bad\nThe worst pain that I ever had\n\nAll the times when I know I should be smiling\nSeem to be the time that I frown the most\nCan't believe that we're still surviving\n'Cause I'm slowly breaking down even when I hold you close\nAnd if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who\nWho I gave my love to\nThat's the reason I stay around\nEven though I fell way\n\nIn too deep, can\u2019t think about giving it up\nBut I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack\nIt\u2019s killing me, swear I never cried so much\n'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad\nThe worst pain that I ever had\nOh woah, never knew love, oh woah\nWould hurt this fucking bad\nThe worst pain that I ever had\n\nAnd it hurts 'cause I wanna leave\nAnd you wanna leave, but the love keeps us together\nAnd if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who, who I gave my love to\nThat's the reason I stay around, even though I fell way\n\nIn too deep, can\u2019t think about giving it up\nBut I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack\nIt\u2019s killing me, swear I never cried so much\n'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad\nThe worst pain that I ever had\nOh woah, never knew love, oh woah\nWould hurt this fucking bad\nThe worst pain that I ever had",
