Baby turn the lights off!\nBaby turn the lights off! Just turn the lights off!\n\nTurn the lights off baby\nI need you to follow my lead\nI wanna make you feel good\nI wanna make you feel like you've never felt before\nCan I do that? Bu Vision\n\nYou're my boo thang, can't get enough\nI love your stuff, let's turn it up, you get what you want\nCause your my boo thang, and when your friends ask\nI'm not your man just the closest thing that you have\nTo a boo thang\n(Boo thang, boo thang, boo thang, boo thang, ooh)\nYou're my boo thang\n(Boo thang, boo thang, boo thang, boo thang, ooh)",
