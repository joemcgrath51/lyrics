(What if I?)\nMade ya cry?\nWould the rules change up\nOr would they still apply?\nIf I played you like a toy\nSometimes I wish I could act like a boy\n\nCan't be getting mad\nWhat you mad?\nCan't handle that\nCan't be getting mad\nWhat you mad?\nCan't handle that\nCan't be getting mad\nWhat you mad?\nCan't handle that\nCan't be getting mad\nWhat you mad?\nCan't handle that\n\nR-A\nIt's The Clutch\nIf I played you (It's Ciara, ha ha)\nWould yo like that?\nHad friends...\nWould you like that? (It's Ciara, ha ha)\nNever call?\nWould you like that? (Another one)\nHell naw\nYou wouldn't like that\nNo!\n\nWhat you mad?\nCan't handle that\n(What if I made you cry?)\nWhy you getting mad?\nWhat you mad?\nCan't handle that\nWould they still apply?\n\nWhat if I\nIf I, played you like a toy\nMade ya cry?\nSometimes I wish I could act like a boy\nCan't handle that",
