The mystery's in the air\nLet's go down to lover's lane with the love we shared\n\nLet's make the time tonight\nWhile the feeling's right\nReminisce on the love we had\n(Reminisce, Reminisce Reminisce)\nLet's make the time tonight\nWhile the feeling's right\nReminisce on the love we had\n\nI can see you standing there alone, like an angel\nTryin' to find his way home\nI don't remember, how we fell apart\nHere we are again, come on, ride into my heart\n\nI recall the days and ways of love we made\nI still feel the heat when we share each other\nDon't you feel the magic? The mystery's in the air\nLet's go down to lover's lane with the love we shared\n\nLet's make the time tonight\nWhile the feeling's right\nReminisce on the love we had\n(Reminisce, Reminisce)\nLet's make the time tonight\nWhile the feeling's right\nReminisce on the love we had\n\nMake the time tonight\nThe feeling's oh so right\nReminisce on the love we had\nMake the time tonight\nMake the time tonight\nThe feeling's oh so right\nReminisce on the love we had\nMake the time tonight\nMake the time tonight\nThe feeling's oh so right\nReminisce on the love we had\nMake the time tonight\nMake the time tonight\nThe feeling's oh so right\nReminisce on the love we had\nMake the time tonight\n\nOoh, Mary\nReminisce\n\nLet's make the time tonight\nFeeling is oh so right\nReminisce on the love we had\nMake the time tonight\nLet's make the time tonight\nFeeling is oh so right\nReminisce on the love we had\nMake the time tonight\nLet's make the time tonight\nFeeling is oh so right\nReminisce on the love we had\nMake the time tonight\nLet's make the time tonight\nFeeling is oh so right\nReminisce on the love we had\nMake the time tonight\n\nI know that we've been here before\nThe candlelight and you, walking softly through my door\nC'mon in my sweet\nTonight we're gonna be more than friends\nFeelings right my, my sweet baby, baby, baby\nI can see you standing there like an angel\nOh boy, ooh reminisce, reminisce on the love we had",
