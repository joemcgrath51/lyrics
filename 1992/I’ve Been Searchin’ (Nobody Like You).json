 "lyrics": "Nobody like you\nNo, no, no, no\nNobody like you\nI've been searching\nI've been looking (yeah)\nEvery now & than\nMakes me wonder (what I'd? Do)\nYou were the best, the best thing, baby\nTo ever come into my life\nWith you I never had to worry\nYou kept me so satisfied\nEvery time, I think about you baby\nGirl you just blow my mind\nHow could I let you get away\nI must have been out of my mind\n(CHORUS)\nI've been searching for so long\nNobody like you\nNo where to be found\nMakes me wonder\nWhat I'd do\nIf I never had someone like you\nYou never know just what you've got\nUntil you let it slip away\nNow Girl, I'm afraid\nThat my heart would never be the same\nTrue loving is so rare\nSomething that's hard to find\nSo if you've got someone special\nTake my advice and hold on tight\nDon't let her go if she means something to you\nYou might find yourself searching\nFrom the yellow brick road\nTo the end of the rainbow\nNobody promised you a pot of gold\nIf you know like I know\nYou better take care of business\nCause you might not ever find another\nWho would treat you the way that she did\n(Chorus)\nNowhere to be found\nMakes me wonder\nWhat I'd do\nIf I never had someone like you\nI can't find nobody\nI've been all over the world and still I can't find nobody\nNobody like you, no where, no where stays on my mind\nTell me what would I do\n(FADE)",
