 "lyrics": "I would give up everything\nBefore I'd separate myself from you\nAfter so much suffering\nI finally found unvarnished truth\nI was all by myself for the longest time\nSo cold inside\nAnd the hurt from the heartache would not subside\nI felt like dying\nUntil you saved my life\n\nThank God I found you\nI was lost without you\nMy every wish and every dream\nSomehow became reality\nWhen you brought the sunlight\nCompleted my whole life\nI'm overwhelmed with gratitude\n'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you\n\nI will give you everything\nThere's nothing in this world I wouldn't do\nTo ensure your happiness\nI'll cherish every part of you\n'Cause without you beside me I can't survive\nDon't wanna try\nIf you keeping me warm each and every night\nI'll be alright\n'Cause I need you in my life\n\nThank God I found you\nI was lost without you\nMy every wish and every dream\nSomehow became reality\nWhen you brought the sunlight\nCompleted my whole life\nI'm overwhelmed with gratitude\n'Cause baby, I'm so thankful I found you\n\nSee, I was so desolate before you came to me\nLooking back\nI guess it shows that we were destined\nTo shine over the rain, to appreciate\nThe gift of what we have\nAnd I'd go through it all over again\nTo be able to feel\nThis way\n\nThank God I found you\nI was lost without you\nMy every wish and every dream\nSomehow became reality\nWhen you brought the sunlight\nCompleted my whole life\nI'm overwhelmed with gratitude\nSee baby, I'm so thankful I found you\nThank God I found you\nI was lost without you\nI'm overwhelmed with gratitude\nMy baby, I'm so thankful I found\nYou\nYou\n\nI'm overwhelmed with gratitude\nMy baby, I'm so thankful I found you",
