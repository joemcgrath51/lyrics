It ain\u2019t even fair\nLook good in whatever she wear\nHow could other women compare? They can\u2019t\n\nI done put another in your space\nDamn, after you, it\u2019s been hard to replace\nI just want the same judge sitting on the case\nShe gon' hate, but she know\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you, down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you, down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you\nGirl, you working with the killer\nAin\u2019t nobody fucking with ya\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you, down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you\n\nI can see the stars in the day time\nBitch, I miss you, like a deadline\nAnd the girl I\u2019m with is just the girl I\u2019m with\nI mean it\u2019s working out, so we\u2019re staying fit\nBut you know love is nothing; ask Stan Smith\nBut I gotta keep a bad bitch, like Brad Pitt\nRemember our first kiss? Or our last kiss?\nI used to go dummy in that pussy; crash test\nYou be fuckin' that nigga like you was fucking me?\nHa, fuck that nigga! He can\u2019t fuck with me\nI\u2019m Tunechi, bitch, and you know that\nAnd that pussy throw back\nBut any given night, I\u2019d still pop that ass, like a Prozac\nGirl, you know you got that murder, a beast in that La Perla\nAnd every time we cut, I used to shred her; Ninja Turtles\nAnd I know you still love me, and I know you still for me\nThat\u2019s why we still fuckin'\n\u2018Cause she don\u2019t put it down like you\n\nI done put another in your space\nDamn, after you, it\u2019s been hard to replace\nI just want the same judge sitting on the case\nShe gon' hate, but she know\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you, down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you, down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you\nGirl, you working with the killer\nAin\u2019t nobody fucking with ya\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you, down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you\n\nLove being around mine, no downtime\nStill nothing else even matters\nCan\u2019t even walk slow through that mall\n\u2018Cause paparazzi running after\nBaby girl working it like a pro, slow it down or move it faster\nWhether them lights on or them lights off\nLike I\u2019m sleeping with the clapper\nSay she watching what she eat, yet that ass keep getting fatter\nHow I\u2019m sexing her\nMakes that ex of hers no longer be a factor\nPlus her and I already know, you done turn them all to Casper\nClimb with the former rather latter\nYou already know which one I\u2019d rather cum on\n\nI done put another in your space\nDamn, after you, it\u2019s been hard to replace\nI just want the same judge sitting on the case\nShe gon' hate, but she know\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you, down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you, down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you\nGirl, you working with the killer\nAin\u2019t nobody fucking with ya\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you, down-down like you\nDown-down like you, down-down like you\nShe don\u2019t put it down like you",
