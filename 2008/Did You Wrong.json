 "lyrics": "You know, I want you all to just sit back and think for a second\nYou know what I mean?\nNow, there's a lot of haters out there hating on peoples relationships and stuff\nDon't nobody wanna see you happy\nThey always try to take your joy, bring you down\nBut you gotta be the one to sit by your mate and say \"I'm gonna be with you no matter what\"\nYou know what I'm saying? Fuck it, I did wrong, you did wrong too\nYou know what I'm saying?\nBut we gotta put up with each others shit\nAnd the easiest thing to do is leave, you dig?\nAnyway, check this out...\n\nI don't want to lose this relationship\nSo we gotta stay strong, don't wanna move on\nI know you're sick and tired of the fussing and the fighting, and the cussing\nWell, I love you ... and you love me too\n\nI did you wrong, you did me wrong\nI take you back, you take me back\nI did you wrong girl, you did me wrong girl\nI'll take you back, I'll take you back\nNo matter what you do\nNo matter what you say\nNo matter how far you go\nDon't take your love away\nBecause I love you\nAnd girl, I want you\nAnd girl, I need you\nSo let's just work it out\n\nI ain't tryna waste your time\nAnd, I ain't tryna waste my time\nThere ain't no need to waste no time\nCause we done put in too much time\nI ain't tryna waste your time\nI ain't tryna waste my time\nAin't no need to waste no time\nCause we done put in too much time\nWhen you're in a relationship\nThe easiest thing for you to do\nIs to leave\nYou gotta stick it out, and work it out\nAnd stick it out, and work it out\nAnd stick it out\nCause at the end of the day...\n\nI did you wrong, you did me wrong\nI take you back, you take me back\nI did you wrong girl, you did me wrong girl\nI'll take you back, I'll take you back\nNo matter what you do\nNo matter what you say\nNo matter how far you go\nDon't take your love away\nBecause I love you\nAnd girl, I want you\nAnd girl, I need you\nSo let's just work it out\n\nI love you baby, I need you in my life\nYou know what I'm saying?\nI'm sick and tired of the arguing and all that good stuff\nI mean, I'm pleading on this track because I really really love you\nAnd, I really want us to work out\nYou know? I want to marry you baby\nYou know? I want you to be in my life for the rest of my life\nYou know what I'm saying?\nAnyway, I'm just talking a whole lot of jibberjabber\nBut uhm me without you is like the moon without the sun\nAnd the sun without the moon\nPleasure P without Pretty Ricky\nYou know what I'm saying?\nA blunt with no dro\nEcstasy with no body\nYou get what I'm saying baby?\nYou dig? Aight.. you dig\nHolla at you boy\nI love you\n\nI did you wrong, you did me wrong\nI take you back, you take me back\nI did you wrong girl, you did me wrong girl\nI'll take you back, I'll take you back\nNo matter what you do\nNo matter what you say\nNo matter how far you go\nDon't take your love away\nBecause I love you\nAnd girl, I want you\nAnd girl, I need you\nSo let's just work it out",
