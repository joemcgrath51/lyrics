 "lyrics": "I used to mess around\nBut I never let it get into me\n'Cause I didn't take you serious, baby\nNow to be without your love\nOnly makes me realize\nWhat I could've had in you, honey\nNow that you're gone\n(Oooooooh ooooh ooooh)\nI want you more\nI said\nIt slapped me in my face\nAnd then my friends don't understand\nBecause I had the chance\nI don't know why\n\nI'm going crazy alone in a daze\nAnd my heart ain't the same\nAnd I don't even think unless\nI think about you\nThat's the only time\nI get sentimental\nThat's the reason why baby\nI can't let go of you\nYeah, that's the only time\nI get sentimental\n\nI miss you day and night\nSeems like you're still here\nI'd rather be together, honey\nNow that I'm lost for words\nI can't believe I'm on my own\nI should've been looking at love\nNow that you're gone\nI want you\n(Oooh ooh oooh)\nI said it slapped me on my face\nAnd now my friends don't understand\nBecause I had the chance\nI don't know why\n\n\nNow that you're gone\nI want you more\nI said it slapped me on my face\nAnd then my friends don't understand\nBecause I had the chance\nI don't know why",
