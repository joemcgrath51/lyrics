 "lyrics": "I know you're thinking\nI've been better off without you by my side\nBut baby, this season\nI don't want another cold rainy July\n\nYou would think that I'd be better now\nBut I'm not\nCause I don't have you\nYou would think that I'd be better now\nBut I'm not\nCause I don't have you\n\nCome back to the world\nCome back to the world\nBaby, back to my world\n\nAnd I still remember\nThe way you used to gently touch my face\nAnd since last December\nI've discovered that no one can take your place\n\n\n\nAnd when the nights get lonely\nI think of what you told me\nSaying that I was the one\nLa, do, day\nLa, do, doh\nLa, do, day\nLa, do, doh\nTell me you can feel it once again\nI know that we can love\nLike we did then\nSo, bring it on home",
