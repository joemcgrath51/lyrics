No problem\nGet on top, then get to bounce around like a low rider\nI'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit\nAfter you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick\nI'm tryin' to explain, baby, the best way I can\nI'll melt in your mouth, girl, not in your hand (Ha-ha)\n[Chorus: 50 Cent & \nOlivia\n]\nI'll take you to the candy shop\nI'll let you lick the lollipop\nGo ahead, girl, don't you stop\nKeep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa\nI'll take you to the candy shop\nWant one taste of what I got?\nI'll have you spendin' all you got\nKeep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa\n[Bridge: 50 Cent & \nOlivia\n]\nGirl, what we do (\nWhat we do\n)\nAnd where we do (\nAnd where we do\n)\nThe things we do (\nThings we do\n)\nAre just between me and you, yeah (\nOh yeah\n)\n\nGive it to me, baby, nice and slow\nClimb on top, ride like you in a rodeo\nYou ain't never heard a sound like this before\n'Cause I ain't never put it down like this\nSoon as I come through the door\nShe get to pullin' on my zipper\nIt's like it's a race, who can get undressed quicker\nIsn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?\nHad me thinkin' 'bout that ass after I'm gone\nI touched the right spot at the right time\nLights on or lights off, she like it from behind\nSo seductive, you should see the way she whine\nHer hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind\nLong as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'\nDrippin' wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'\nAll my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on\nAnd we gon' sip 'til every bubble in every bottle is gone\n[Chorus: 50 Cent & \nOlivia\n]\nI'll take you to the candy shop\nI'll let you lick the lollipop\nGo ahead, girl, don't you stop\nKeep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa\nI'll take you to the candy shop\nWant one taste of what I got?\nI'll have you spendin' all you got\nKeep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa\n[Chorus: 50 Cent & \nOlivia\n]\nI'll take you to the candy shop\nI'll let you lick the lollipop\nGo ahead, girl, don't you stop\nKeep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa\nI'll take you to the candy shop\nWant one taste of what I got?\nI'll have you spendin' all you got\nKeep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa",
