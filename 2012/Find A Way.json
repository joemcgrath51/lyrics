 "lyrics": "This ain't no game, no trophy win\nNo contest rules to box you in\nGirl you're more than that to me\nYou're the Michelle to my dreams\nNo rush, no stress, why worry fear\nI chill, won't push no pressure here\nThere's nothing wrong with waiting\nFor something so amazing girl\nI gotta find\n\nI gotta find away to win your, find away to win your\nFind away to win your heart girl\nI gotta find away to win your, find away to win your\nFind away to win your trust girl\nI gotta find away to win your, find away to win your\nFind away to win your love girl\nI gotta find a way\nNo matter what it takes\nGirl, I gotta find a way\n\nYour lips, your  face, your feet, your hair\nThe way you speak, intelligent\nAnd baby girl I'm listening (talk to me)\nYou got my full attention\nYour style, your grace, your elegance\nYou must have been made by his hands\nA natural beauty\nI'm hoping that you choose me\nI gotta find\n\n\nNow no money could buy you\nSo I will never try to buy my way into your heart\nBut baby if you let me play my part\nLove can be reborn\nI know you've been torn and scorn\nBaby it's been so long\nLove has been so obsolete\nSeen the opposition made you weak\nBut I'm here, here to find a way",
