 "lyrics": "Sometimes you can work it out\nSometimes you can't\nSometimes you're forced to watch everything fall apart\nIt's outta your hands\nSometimes leaving is easy\nSometimes it ain't\nSometimes it hurts to know\nThe loving you had is slowly fading away\n\nYou can say whatever you like\nAs long as we just say goodbye\n\nBlame it on me (blame it on me)\nSay it's my fault (say it's my fault)\nSay that I left you outside in the cold with a broken heart\nI really don't care, I ain't crying no more\nSay I'm a liar, a cheater\nSay anything that you want as long as it's over\n\nI ain't a quitter\nI just ain't the type\nI tried to see you through\nI tried to make it to the finishing line\nYou thought it was meant to be, yeah?\nI admit, so did I\nEvery once in a while\nYou think you figured it out\nSometimes you're not right\n\nYou can say whatever you like\nAs long as we just say goodbye\n\nBlame it on me (blame it on me)\nSay it's my fault (say it's my fault)\nSay that I left you outside in the cold with a broken heart\nI really don't care (really don't care), I ain't crying no more (ain't crying no more)\nSay I'm a liar, a cheater\nSay anything that you want as long as it's over\n\nYes, I love you\nBut I really got to lose you\nFreedom's where I wanna be\nYes, I'll probably always love you\nBut I'm moving\nGotta do this for me\nBlame it on me (blame it on me)\nSay it's my fault (say it's my fault)\nSay that I left you outside in the cold with a broken heart\nI really don't care (really don't care), I ain't crying no more (ain't crying no more)\nSay I'm a liar, a cheater\nSay anything that you want\nBlame it on me (blame it on me)\nSay it's my fault (say it's my fault)\nSay that I left you outside in the cold with a broken heart\nI...don't care (really don't care), I ain't crying no more (ain't crying no more)\nSay I'm a liar, a cheater\nSay anything that you want...\nAs long as it's over",
