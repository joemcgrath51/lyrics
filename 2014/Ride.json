 "lyrics": "I've been out on that open road\nYou can be my full-time daddy\n, white and gold\nSinging blues has been getting old\nYou can be my full-time baby, hot or cold\n\nDon't break me down (Don't break me down)\nI've been traveling too long (I've been traveling too long)\nI've been trying too hard (I've been trying too hard)\nWith one pretty song (With one pretty song)\n\nI hear the birds on the summer breeze\nI drive fast,\n I am alone at midnight\nBeen trying hard not to get into trouble\nBut I, I've got a war in my mind\nSo, I just ride, just ride\nI just ride, I just ride\n\nDying young and playing hard\nThat's the way my father made his life and art\nDrink all day and we talk 'til dark\nThat's the way you road dogs do it\nLight 'til dark\n\nDon't leave me now (Don't leave me now)\nDon't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)\nDon't turn around (Don't turn around)\nLeave me high and dry (Leave me high and dry)\n\nI hear the birds on the summer breeze\nI drive fast,\n I am alone at midnight\nBeen trying hard not to get into trouble\nBut I, I've got a war in my mind\nI just ride, just ride\nI just ride, I just ride\n\nI'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy\nI'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes\nIt's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby\nSo I just ride, I just ride\n\nHear the birds on the summer breeze\nI drive fast, I am alone at midnight\nBeen trying hard not to get into trouble\nBut I, I've got a war in my mind\nI just ride, just ride\nI just ride, I just ride",
