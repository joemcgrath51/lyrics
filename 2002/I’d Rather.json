 "lyrics": "I thought sometime alone\nWas what we really needed\nYou said this time would hurt more than it helps\nBut I couldn't see that\nI thought it was the end\nOf a beautiful story\nAnd so I left the one I loved at home to be alone (alone)\nAnd I tried to find\nOut if this one thing is true\nThat I'm nothing without you\nI know better now\nAnd I've had a change of heart\nI'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else\nI'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself\nI'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart\nI'd rather have the one who holds my heart\nWhoo-oo-oo-oo yeah\nAnd then I met someone\nAnd thought she could replace you\nWe got a long just fine\nWe wasted time because he was not you\nWe had a lot of fun\nThough we knew we were faking\nLove was not impressed with our connection they were all lies, all lies\nSo I'm here cause I found this one thing is true\nThat I'm nothing without you\nI know better now\nAnd I've had a change of heart\nI'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else\nI'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself\nI'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart\nI'd rather have the one who holds my heart\nWho holds my heart\nI can't blame you if you turn away from me, like I've done you\nI can only prove the things I say with time\nPlease be mine\nI'd rather have bad times with (please be mine) you\nThan good times with someone else (I know)\nI'd rather be beside you in a storm (anytime)\nThan safe and warm by myself (so sure baby)\nI'd rather have hard times to gether\nThan to have it easy apart\nI'd rather have the one who holds my heart (my heart)\nI'd rather have bad times with you (surely)\nThan good times with someone else (surely)\nI'd rather be beside you in a storm (oh yeah)\nThan safe and warm by myself (all by myself)\nI'd rather have hard times together\nThan to have it easy apart (you know it)\nI'd rather have the one who holds my heart\nI'd rather have the one who holds my heart\nI'd rather have the one who holds my heart\nWhoooo.....who holds my heart",
