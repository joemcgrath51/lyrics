Tell me what I\u2019m gon' do?\nSince everything that I\u2019m trying to forget is all true\nMe and all your main girls get along too\nI would take my last dollar out and bet it on you\nBut uh, you see the same one I\u2019m missing\nIs basically the reason I became something different\nAnd just that I remember me before\nAnd if you could do the same, baby, then we\u2019d be for sure\n\nSo selfishly, you can only show feelings\nWhen you feel yours in jeopardy\nOh, time, oh, time has changed and I\u2019m no longer willing\nCan't you see how my heart is bleeding?\nI guess I\u2026\n[Hook: Diddy & \nDirty Money\n]\nLovin' you no more\nI just, I can't, I just can\u2019t be lovin' you no more \n(No, lovin' you no more)\nI love you more than I love myself \n(No, no)\nLovin' you no more \n(I can't)\nI just, I can't, I just can\u2019t be lovin' you no more \n(No, woah)\nI love you more than I love myself\nLovin' you no more \n(Oh, no)\nI just, I can't, I just can\u2019t be lovin' you no more\nI love you more than I love myself\nLovin' you no more\nI just, I can't, I just can\u2019t be lovin' you no more \n(Just wanna love you baby)\nI love you more than I love myself \n(Just wanna love you baby)",
