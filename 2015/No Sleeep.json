(yeah that\u2019s nice)\nWe ain\u2019t gonna get no sleep (need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)\nWe ain\u2019t gonna get no sleep (need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)\nWe ain\u2019t gonna get no sleep\n\nI go my way, you go yours\nYou taste real life, I taste tours (alright)\nSweet at first, but after a while\nToo much sugar, they say, is bad for your smile\nAnd I wear a frown now, 'cause I miss real\nI miss a warm house, and home cooked meals\nAnd you miss junk food, that\u2019s why we work\nYou bring cooked food and I bring dessert\nUh, and meet up at the place that we always do\nThe one swimming through my mind, that was always you\nOur time together has inspired a song or two\nOr three, or four, or more, mi amor\nI\u2019m sure, either you\u2019re the one or I\u2019m caught in the matrix\nStaying up for hours while we talk and get wasted\nNot from weed smoke, or this cheap wine\nDrunk off love we both feel deep down\nBut too scared to say cause we know how this ends\nThinking, maybe we\u2019d be better off friends with benefits\nFor the moment this adrenaline, got me feeling like a kid again\nButterflies like MJ, had to fit it in\nMy schedule, check the bezel, gotta escape by six\nDamn, how\u2019d it get so late so quick?\nThe sun rising (already?) until the next time\nI love diving in your mind and coming out with every diamond I can find (We ain't gonna get no sleep)\nNo sleep, no sleep\n\nCan't stop, yeah  (we not, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)\nCan't stop (just a lil more, now, just a lil more now) we ain\u2019t gonna get no sleep (no sleep)\n\nPlush...\nSide two...",
