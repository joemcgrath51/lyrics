(Why you all in?)\nCan you pay my bills? (Can you pay my bills?)\nLet me know if you will (Let me know, me know)\n'Cause a chick gotta live (A chick like me, I got to live)\n\nTalk is talk, and talk is cheap\nTell it to her, don't say it to me\n'Cause I know I'm in control\nSee, Trix are for kids, and boo I'm too old\nGo 'head with your games\nDon't ever come back to me again\nWhere you go, remember me\nI'm the best thing in history\n\nWhy you all in my grill? (Why, why, why?)\nCan you pay my bills (Can you pay my bills?)\nLet me know if you will (Let me know boy, boy)\n'Cause a chick gotta live\n(A chick got to live, ooh yeah)\n\nThird time (Third time)\nI moved you in, took you back\nIn my life (I was a fool)\nI don't know what's wrong with me\nThird time (Third time)\nI moved you in, took you back in my life (oh yeah, yeah)\n\nWhy you all in my grill? (All in my grill)\nCan you pay my bills? (Can you pay my bills, yeah)\nLet me know if you will (Let me know if you will)\n'Cause a chick gotta live (Oh, yeah)\nWhy you all in my grill?\nCan you pay my bills? (Ooh, pay my bills)\nLet me know if you will (Let me know, let me know baby, baby)\n'Cause a chick gotta live (A chick like me, I got to live)\n\nIf you want me, where's my dough?\nGive me money, buy me clothes\nNo need for talking, have my dough\nWhere's my money? Where's my clothes?\nIf you want me, where's my dough?\nGive me money, buy me clothes\nNo need for talking, have my dough? (Aight, uh)\nWhere's my money? Where's my clothes?\n\nWhy you all in my grill?\nI'm thinkin' it's time to chill\nYeah, but you wanna drill, though\nI couldn't even step out the baby blue Bonneville\nCuz you be tryin' to kill my ho, my girlfriend\nAnd people around me is tellin' me that you's a stalker\nLike Darth Vader takes a Skywalker\nI told you I was the street talker\nIt ain't my fault you gave me your Victoria's Secret's\nAnd your Frederick's\nYou wanted the Waldorf Astoria\nBut instead I took you to Cedric's, to entertain you\nTo give you to the \"G\", and never claim you\nMe and Missy, we gettin' straight pissy\nAnd oh yeah, we puffin' on one of them thangs too\nYou blamin' who? You namin' who?\nI know you ain't bringin' that lame crew\nBig Boi, Daddy Fat Sax\nG pretty D, are they same, boo\nBut I'm backed by the Dungeon Family\nSo you can go 'head wit' all that stabbin' me\nCuz I will jab thee, and slam thee\nAnd Bobby Boucher yo' ass, G\nYeah, yeah, huh",
