Hmm\nI, I, I, I've been through some things\nPlease don't hold that against me\nCan't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you\nCan't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you\nEven though I, I, I still can feel a sting\nNo need to second guess me\nCan't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you\nCan't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you\nSee I, I, I, I, I don't mind you\nPutting up a little bit of fight, it's alright\nBut why run from what's gonna hold you tight\nThrough any complications, baby, maybe we can start tonight!\nHey! I saw the dirty look you gave me\nDon't care what your ex do\nCan't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you!\nAin't no one gonna love you, like I'm gonna love you!\nAnd if you dare, don't dare\nSend me straight to voice mail\nBaby I'm just gonna text you\nHope it ain't no issue, I just gotta let you\nKnow no one to love you like I'm gonna love you!\nSee I, I, I, I, I don't mind you\nPutting up a little bit of fight, it's alright\nBut why run from what's gonna hold you tight\nThrough any complications, baby, maybe we can start tonight!\nOh, oh, oh!\nI put that on everything!\nAin't no one gonna love you!\nAin't no one gonna hold you!\nShow you what I could show you!\nSomebody better told you!\nOh, oh, oh!\nBaby, your name's spelled out in every heartbeat!\nAin't no one gonna love you!\nAin't no one gonna hold you!\nShow you what I could show you!\nBut if you should go down that same road\nYou've been before\nYou're in reverse, your pain rehearsed,just brace yourself for the blow\nBut don't you know that you could just let it go?\nDon't you know\nI, I, I, I've been through some things\nPlease don't hold that against me\nCan't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you\nCan't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you\nDon't you know I, I, I, I, I'm making you this promise\nClutchin' on a rosary\nAin't no one gonna love you, like I'm gonna love you!\nAin't no one gonna love you, like I'm gonna love you!\nOh, oh, oh, oh!\nI put that on everything\nAin't no one gonna love you\nAin't no one gonna hold you\nShow you what I could show you!\nSomebody better tell you!\nOh, Oh, Oh!\nI, I, I, I've been through some things\nPlease don't hold that against me\nCan't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you\nCan't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you\nDon't you know I, I, I, I, I'm making you this promise\nClutchin' on a rosary\nAin't no one gonna love you, like I'm gonna love you!\nAin't no one gonna love you, like I'm gonna love you!\nOh, oh, oh, oh!",
