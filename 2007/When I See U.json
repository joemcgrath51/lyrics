 "lyrics": "I put your picture on my mirror\nStart to blush when somebody says your name\nIn my stomach there's a pain\nSee you walk in my direction\nI go the other way\nI start to stutter when I speak\nTry to stand but my knees go weak\nWhat's happening to me?\nAnybody can you tell me what it means?\nI lay my head on my pillow\nStaring out the window\nWish on a star for a sign\nIs this the reason why\n\nYou're always on my mind\nWhen you come around, I get shy\nWhen I see you, when I see you\nNever know when you might walk by\nSo I gotta be right on time\nWhen I see you, when I see you\n\nI scribble X's and O's in my notebook\nChecking how my hair and nails look\nI feel myself in the zone\nI get nervous when you call\nSo I say I'm not home\nI see your face\nWhen I hear my favorite song\nShould I send a email at home\nYou're the number one topic on the phone\nI wonder if you know or do you have a clue?\nI lay my head on my pillow\nYou got me staring out the window\nWish on a star for a sign\nWhat's the reason why?\nYeah\n\nYou're always on my mind\nWhen you come around, I get shy\nWhen I see you, when I see you\nNever know when you might walk by\nSo I gotta be right on time\nWhen I see you, when I see you\n\nSomething now is taking over me\nYeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\nI'm not gonna run\nI'm, just gonna stand here and see\nOoooo, yeah\n\nYou're always on my mind\nWhen you come around, I get shy\nWhen I see you, when I see you\nNever know when you might walk by\nSo I gotta be right on time\nWhen I see you, when I see you\nYou're always on my mind\nWhen you come around, I get shy\nWhen I see you, when I see you\nNever know when you might walk by\nSo I gotta be right on time\nWhen I see you, when I see you",
