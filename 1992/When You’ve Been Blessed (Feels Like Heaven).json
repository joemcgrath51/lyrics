 "lyrics": "In a world\nOf superheros\nIn a world\nOf weak and strong\nIn a sea of have and have nots\nI've survived the raging storm\nAnd I pray for a world\nWhere we all can be free\nIt's a heavenly vision\nIt's a garden I see\nNothing but joy\nNothing but peace\nLet it be\nWhen you've been blessed\nFeels like heaven\nHeaven\nWhen you've been blessed\nFeels like Heaven\nHeaven\nI have faith\nI have hope\nAnd I trust in the day\nWhen the music\nFrom Heaven\nWill show us the way\nIt's a garden of music\nIt's a garden of love\nAnd we all are His children\nSharing gifts from above\nWhen you've been blessed\nFeels like Heaven\nHeaven\nWhen you've been blessed\nFeels like Heaven\nHeaven\nWhen you've been blessed\nFeels like Heaven\nHeaven\nWhen you've been blessed\nPass it on\nPass it on\nWhy don't you?\nWhy don't you?\nPass it on\nAnd on\nAnd on\nAnd on\nWhen you've been blessed\nThat's what it feels like\nYes\nThere'll be no more sorrow\nNo more pain\nNothing but joy, joy, joy\nNo more sickness\nNo more strife\nNothing but love, love, love\nAnd everybody we will get together and say\n(Heaven) Say\n(Heaven) Say\nThat's what it feels like\nWhen you've been blessed\nI'm blessed\nYes, I am\nI talked to my mother\nMy father\nMy sistas\nAnd they said, girl, you are blessed\nSo pass it on\nPass it on\nDon't keep it to yourself\nWe're not talking about prayer\nTalking about yourself\nNot silver or gold\nSomething\nSomewhere\nYou've got to pass it on",
