 "lyrics": "Feels like I'm goin' in circles\nYou're like a maze I can't get through\nShould I go left? Should I go right?\nShould I let you stay for the night?\nIt's like a seesaw when it comes to your love\nBoy, when you're up, this girl is down\nAnd I just can't figure it out\n\n'Cause you know that I want you\nAnd you know that I need you\nIs that any way to be?\nJust have your way with me\nMy body is cryin'\nThese tears - can you wipe 'em?\nIs that any way to be?\nJust have your way with me\n\nI'm goin' out with guys I don't wanna go\nTo places that I've been before\nThey pitchin' the same game\nBoy, it's a damn shame\nHow I wish it was you callin' me\nI want it to be you holdin' me\nBoy, it needs to be you kissin' me\n'Cause it's like a seesaw, when it comes to your love\nBoy, when you're up, this girl is down\nAnd I just can't figure it out\n\n'Cause you know that I want you\nAnd you know that I need you\nIs that any way to be?\nJust have your way with me\nMy body is cryin'\nThese tears - can you wipe 'em?\nIs that any way to be?\nJust have your way with me\n\nListen\nHave your way with me anytime, anywhere\nHave your way however, I don't care\nHave your way with me\nAnd you can have it tonight\nTonight, tonight, boy, tonight\n\n'Cause you know that I want you\nAnd you know that I need you\nIs that any way to be?\nJust have your way with me\nMy body is cryin'\nThese tears - can you wipe 'em?\nIs that any way to be?\nJust have your way with me\n'Cause you know that I want you\nAnd you know that I need you\nIs that any way to be?\nJust have your way with me\nMy body is cryin'\nThese tears - can you wipe 'em?\nIs that any way to be?\nJust have your way with me",
