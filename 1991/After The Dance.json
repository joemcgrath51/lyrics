Fine\nLookin' good on the Soul Train\nSo good\nI cannot get you sharp and right\nYou was dancin' good-spinnin' everywhere\nI thought to myself\nShe was so fine\nThe ways she you moved\nSo fine\nShe's movin' so real, I need her\nWhat she needs is me\nI want you-and you want me\nSo why don't we-\nGet together after the dance\nWhile we danced\nLet's break this baby\nYou were so fine\nThe way you moved me\nYour warm eyes\nTold me one thing\nOh baby, there was a vibe between you and me\nThat you needed my sweet lovin', baby\nNobody else's girl, nobody's love my baby\nThat's how'd I feel if I was you\nI want you to take me with you\nWhat'cha gonna do\nI want you-and you want me\nSo why don't we-\nGet together after the dance\nDance with me\nCome on dance with me, baby\nDance with me\nCome on dance with me, baby\nDance with me\nCome on dance with me, baby\nDance with me\nCome on dance with me, baby\nI want you-and you want me\nSo why don't we-",
