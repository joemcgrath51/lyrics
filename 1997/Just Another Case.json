Cuz that's when L started his bid\nPartied through the New Year\nJanuary third he slid\nUp until then, yo, L had it swell\nCalled him Sweet Pea like his name was Pernell\nHe did the job, money came with ease\nBlowing outta town, moving bricks and ki's\nHim and his chick, in forty-G rides\nHolding down fort like they Bonnie N Clyde\nLuxury cars of all makes and models\nNew outfits everyday, downin' champagne by the bottle\nGlass in the air (air)\nToast to my team (team)\nToast to my cream and the scotties that beam\nWhile others fiend, I'm abouts da beamer\nThink about your girl, just say what (Say what!), I'm a dreamer\nCalled up cru\nYo, they probably in the studio\nPhil Collins in the background\n(Su-Su-Sudio)\nChorus: repeat 3X\nNow this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh\nJust another case about the wrong path\n(Where's my chick?) Sent her on a mission\nHope she ain't slip... On that pickup\nYo, who this on my flip\nWhat! My cash and he fucked her wit dat A\nMe and Mitch rollin' over there quick fast\nRolled up on the spot, (It's that kid Uzi Ed)\nHe took me for my paper so just call him Uzi Dead!\nUsed to run epps wit him back in the day\nMitch popped the trunk\nPassed the German ak\nYou dirty rat! I'm bout to bless that ass\nBetter take cover from the rat-tat-tat-tat\nUzi Ed, ain't have a vest, three to the chest, Ed got blessed\nL got life, Ed got death\nHoney took the money and she slid to the left\nBack in the day I told L she was shady\nNow she in Cali about to have Ed's baby\nChorus: repeat 5",
