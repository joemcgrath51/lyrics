Eh\nRum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum\nMi say wah man down\nA weh mi say\nRum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum\nWhen mi went downtown\n'Cause now I am criminal, criminal, criminal\nOh Lord, oh mercy, now I am a criminal\nMan down\nTell the judge please gimme minimal\nRun outta town, none a dem can see mi now, see mi now\n\nOh, mama, mama, mama\nI just shot a man down\nIn Central Station\nIn front of a big ol' crowd\nOh, why?\nOh, why?\nOh, mama, mama, mama\nI just shot a man down\nIn Central Station",
