Yeah\nI'm with you\n\nYeah, linking me down on my line\nBusy as usual but we should make some time\nLooking for things you can find\nJust so you can have something to bring up when it's time\nMixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions\nDry cry cause I'm hopeless\nChoosey lover for the moment\nDifferent story when I leave you\nStory up just to keep you\nI need you 'round, I need you, oh\n\nIt's about us right now, girl, where you going?\nIt's about us right now, girl, where you going?\nI'm with you\nIt's all about us right now, girl, where you going?\nIt's all about us right now, girl, where you going?\nI'm with you, I'm with you",
