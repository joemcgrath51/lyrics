 "lyrics": "I'm home alone again\nAnd you're out, hanging with your friends\nSo you say, somehow I know its not quite that way\nIt's getting pretty late, and you haven't checked on me all day\nWhen I called, you didn't answer\nNow I'm feeling like you're ignoring me\nI wish,that you were home, holding me tight in your arms\nI wish,I could go back, to the day before we met and skip my regret\n\nI wish I wasn't in love with you\nSo you couldn't hurt me\nIt just ain't fair the way you treat me\nNo you don't deserve me\nWasted my time thinking bout you and you ain't never gone change\nI wish I wasn't in love with you so I wouldn't feel this way\n\nWhen you touch me my heart melts\nAnd everything you did wrong I forget\nSo you play me and take advantage of the love that I feel for you\nWhy you wanna hurt me so bad\nI believed in you that's why I'm so mad\nNow I'm drowning in disappointment, and it's hard for me to even look at you\nI wish, that you were home, holding me tight in your arms. Oooh baby\nI wish, I could go back\nTo the day before we met and skip my regret\n\n\nSaid you care about me, but from what I see\nI ain't feeling all that, so I disagree\nGave you all my love and understanding\nYet you treated me like your enemy\nSo leave me alone, don't want nothin' from you\nJust go back where you came from\nThis house is no longer your home\nYou're not welcome no, no, no,more\n\n\nHear you knockin' at the door again\nI'm wonderin' should I let you in\nI open up the door and see\nThe flowers for me\nSo\nBeautiful in your hand\nPlease stop begging me to take you back\nI've always been a sucker for romance\nAnd before you know\nIt I concede\nYou're all over me\nOh no here I go again\nI wish I wasn't in love with you\nSo you couldn't hurt me",
