Let's get it\n\nGirl you hypnotize me, love the way you move it\nSit back like a player while you doin' what you doin'\nWhisper in my ear tellin' me how she gon' do me\nOh I think she likes me so it's time to make a movie\nTime to make a, ah ah, time to make a movie\nTime to make a, oh yeah, it's time to make a movie\nTime to make a, ah ah, time to make a movie\nOh I think she likes me so it's time to make a movie\n\nLet's get it\nYou know what it is homegirl let's get it\nYour little boyfriend ain't ever know that we did it\nGotta homegirl let me know if she with it\nTwo girls, one bed let me know and we'll split it. Quit it\nTell me how he gonna know, way too much bread no Keebler though\nWhen I see money I speed to the door\nIf it ain't no doe I speed to the doe\nWhere she finna go, stick to the script get used to my plot\nMaking it wet no use of a prop\nI'll make you regret not using a mop\nBooze to your stock, you looking hot\nSo I bet that we gonna Tom Cruise to the top\nI could turn the Ros\u00e9 down to the south\nAnd I love how your mouth never losing the drop\nEy, you could have it girl\nNot an amateur, I could manage ya\nCandy car looking bluer than an Avatar\nI'll help you get your groove back like Angela\nI could handle her, show her I'm the best\nAn Academy Award yeah the Oscars next\nAnd Trey Songz telling you that he invented sex\nI guess you can say that I invented checks\n\n\nWhat's up little mama, come and meet me your manager\nBe your photographer, you be the one ima take a picture of (click)\nYou could be on my cinema, then ima get you whatever you want\nThen ima do anything to get your love\nHit it from the back and hit it from the front\nAnd ima look in the camera so I could let em know it's up in it (Twista)\nWhen I'm filmin', I'll be ready, next triple\nCause I suck on your nipples and every movie you gon be up in it\nPull me out and people be classy and but when we get some privacy baby you can be my porn star\nKeep the lights on\nCause I wanna see it, it's better for shootin'\nAnd how you be lookin' I see you goin' far\nSee me blow you a kiss, you blow it right back\nOpenin' up your legs now you on the right track\nLet me aim the camera down while you wipe that\nLookin' freaky up at the legs, do you like that?\nThat, that. I'll be workin' your body like I be working the pictures in the portfolio\nI don't know if it was a face, it was a hair, it was an ass, that made me want to put you up in the video\nIt's the Twista with the Chamillionaire\nMurder in the booth when I smoke a philly in there\nI'll be the director come and gimme a chair\nStar quality I'll see if it's really in there\n\nGirl you hypnotize me, love the way you move it\nSit back like a player while you doin' what you doin'\nWhisper in my ear tellin' me how she gon' do me\nOh I think she likes me so it's time to make a movie\nAin't no need to be nervous, we can get some room service\nI can give it how you want it girl if that's okay\nTime to make a movie, movie, time to make a movie\nGotta tell me how you want it, you know ima be up on it from the night till the mornin' girl if that's okay\nTime to make a movie, movie, time to make a movie\nOne, two, three, go. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah\nOh, she likes me, oh. Let's get it\nOne, two, three, go. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah\nOh, she likes me, oh\nLet's make a movie",
