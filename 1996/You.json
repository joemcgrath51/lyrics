 "lyrics": "So you say that you can't go on\nLove left you cryin'\nAnd you say all your hope is gone\nAnd what's the use in tryin'\nWhat you need is to have some faith\nShake off those sad blues\nGet yourself a new view\nOh, nothing is a sad as it seems, you know\n'Cause someday you'll laugh at the heartache\nSomeday, you'll laugh at the pain\nSomehow you'll get through the heartache\nSomehow you can get through the rain\nWhen love puts you through the fire\nWhen love puts you through the test\nNothing cures a broken heart\nLike time, love and tenderness\nWhen you think your world is over\nBaby just remember this\nNothing heals a broken heart\nLike time, love and tenderness\nTime, love and tenderness\nI understand how you're feeling now\nAnd what you've been through\nBut your world's gonna turn around\nSo baby don't you be blue\nAll it takes is a little time\nTo make it better\nThe hurt won't last forever\nOh, all the tears are gonna dry you know\n'Cause someday you'll laugh at the heartache\nSomeday you'll laugh at the pain\nYou may be down on your luck\nBut baby that old lucks gonna change\nWhen love puts you through the fire\nWhen love puts you through the test\nNothing cures a broken heart\nLike time, love and tenderness\nWhen you think your world is over\nBaby just remember this\nNothing heals a broken heart\nLike time, love and tenderness\nTime, love and tenderness\nBaby, oh baby you just need some\nYou just need some\nTime, love and tenderness\nTime, love and tenderness\nThe hurt ain't gonna last forever\nTime, love and tenderness\nTime, love and tenderness",
