 "lyrics": "It's like you're looking through a telescope\nYou see where you gon be\nGrowing getting better\nYou're not the person they see\nCan't be mad at the things you've been through\nCuz they built your muscle\nNow you're stronger than you ever been\nThey can't stop your hustle\nYo faith ain't never small that's what brought you this far (yeah) See you got yo dreams and you got your prayers and you got your God he gon take you there\nSee everybody has a season\nAnd i believe this one's yours\nSee you've been working waiting this what you've been praying for\n\nGo get it (5x)\nGo get your blessing\nGo get it (5x)\nIt's yo time (4x)\nYou were made to live a good life and that's what i believe\nSay a prayer hit the floor start working you gotta do something It's alright to crawl before you walk, it's alright to walk before you run\nBut if wanna get what you never got gotta do something that you never done\n\n\nYou've been qualified\nBut his mercy multiplied\nYou cannot be denied\nCuz you're finally certified\nIt's official\nGo ahead and testify\nHe's gon bless you\nYou gon bless him\nNow God be glorified",
