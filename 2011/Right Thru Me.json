 "lyrics": "You see right through me\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you?\nHow do you?\nHow do you?\nHow do you?\nHow do you?\n\nYou let me win, you let me ride\nYou let me rock, you let me slide\nAnd when they lookin', you let me hide\nDefend my honor, protect my pride\nThe good advice I always hated\nBut lookin' back, it made me greater\nYou always told me forget the haters\nJust get my money, just get my weight up\nKnow when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'\nIt's like you got it down to a science\nWhy am I tryin'? Know you ain't buyin'\nI tried to fight it back with defiance\nYou make me laugh, you make me hoarse\nFrom yellin' at you and gettin' at you\nPickin up dishes, throwin' 'em at you\nWhy are you speakin' when no one asked you?\n\nYou see right through me\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you?\nHow do you?\nHow do you?\nHow do you?\nHow do you?\nYou see right through me\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you? (Do that)\nHow do you? (Do that)\nHow do you? (Do that)\nHow do you? (Do that)\nHow do you?\n\nWhat are we doin'? Could you see through me?\n'Cause you say, \"Nicki,\" and I say, \"Who, me?\"\nAnd you say, \"No, you,\" and I say, \"Screw you\"\nThen you start dressin' and you start leavin'\nAnd I start cryin' and I start screamin'\nThe heavy breathin', but what's the reason?\nAlways get the reaction you wanted\nI'm actually frontin', I'm askin' you somethin', yo\nAnswer this question, class is in session\nTired of lettin' passive-aggression\nControl my mind, capture my soul\nOkay, you're right, just let it go\nOkay, you got it, it's in the can\nBefore I played it, you knew my hand\nYou could turn a free throw to a goal\nNigga got the peephole to my soul\n\nYou see right through me\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you?\nHow do you?\nHow do you?\nHow do you?\nHow do you?\nYou see right through me\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you? (Do that)\nHow do you? (Do that)\nHow do you? (Do that)\nHow do you? (Do that)\nHow do you?\n\nStop (Ooh)\nStop (Ooh)\nWon't you just stop lookin' through me? 'Cause I can't take it\nNo, I can't take it (You see right)\n\nYou see right through me\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you do that shit?\nHow do you?\nHow do you?\nHow do you?\nHow do you?\nHow do you?\nYou see right through me\nYou see right through me, baby\nYou see right through me (Do that shit)\nYou see right through me (How do you do that shit?)\nHow do you do that? How do you do that?\nHow do you do that? How do you do that?\nBaby",
