 "lyrics": "I was in love with you\nI gave my heart to you\nI did my best to keep you satisfied\nYou took the love from me\nAnd used it selfishly\nYou did not give back your love to me at all\n\nI gave the sun to you\nYou said it was too bright\nI gave you diamond rings\nYou said they didn't shine\nI gave my world to you\nYou said it's not enough\nWhat in the world could I have done to make you be so rough\n\n'Til you do me right\nI don't even want to talk to you\nI don't even wanna hear you speak my name\nAnd 'til you do me right\nOnly wrong is gonna come to you\nNothing good is gonna come to you 'til your change your ways\nUntil you change your evil ways\n\nGirl I was there for you\nSomeone you could talk to\nHow could you just keep breaking my heart?\nWhat did I do to you\nTo make you be so cruel?\nI don't understand why you've been so wrong\n\nI tried to be your strength\nYou said I was too strong\nI tried to compromise\nSo we could get along\nI gave my love to you\nDespite your evil ways\nI guess it's clear to me, there's only one thing left to say\n\n'Til you do me right\nI don't even want to talk to you\nI don't even wanna hear you speak my name\n'Til you do me right\nOnly wrong is gonna come to you\nNothing good is gonna come to you 'til your change your ways\nUntil you change your evil ways\n\nThere's a time when you know what you feel inside your heart\nIt's telling you that something is strange\nOoh girl, you don't have to deny it\nAll you got to do is just try it\nYou'll find our love is stronger if you're willing to change\n\n'Til you do me right\nI don't even want to talk to you\nI don't even wanna hear you speak my name\n'Til you do me right\nOnly wrong is gonna come to you\nNothing good is gonna come to you 'til your change your ways\n'Til you do me right\nI don't even want to talk to you\nI don't even wanna hear you speak my name\n'Til you do me right\nOnly wrong is gonna come to you\nNothing good is gonna come to you 'til your change your ways\nUntil you change your ways\n'Til you do me right\nI don't even want to talk to you\nI don't even wanna hear you speak my name\n'Til you do me right",
