 "lyrics": "Do you ever see that stuff that be\nWhen it get cold\nThat ice that you can't see?\nSee that shit happens sometimes\nYep\nBlack ice\n\nNow you know and I know\nI done bumped every hole in the wall, y'all\nDid you catch that phone call?\nMost of y'all that met me thought I was tall\nGipp flipped like a dip, slipped, fell on the black ice\nDid you think twice? Homeslice came and he went\nSatisfied, got bent, bars ain't shit\nMutant, coast to coast, yeah, I laughed and boast\nMan, do-si-dos, too many comin' close to\n\nTouch what I never touched before\nSeen what I never seen befo'\nWoke up and seen the sun\nSky high, sky high\n\nCirculate like a Sunday paper\nCapers caught long time, to cheap flicks, good picks\nPaid hard, watch the hard turn sideways\nCook the 'tail for real sales to those who lose cash\nPlayers keep your life for now\nFeeling good and warm, windows rolled tight\nThirty-five degrees, nippy tonight\nDon't forget the ChapStick, lips dry quick\nWhen the jack out, make you wanna act out\nTake the slack out, some people black out\nHibernatin' 'til we came back out\n\nTouch what I never touched before\nSeen what I never seen befo'\nWoke up and seen the sun\nSky high, sky high (Sky high)\nTouch what I never touched before\nSeen what I never seen befo'\nWoke up and seen the sun\nSky high, sky high\n\nI been in it for the past few days\nTighter than fades, I'm knowin' my plays\nNow can I rap? Can I adapt? Not really sure yet\nWho that lookin' over the shoulders of those writin' dreams?\nFiending for the taste of menthol\nMissed class, stayed in the hall\nLookin' for a squeeze play, better, yet a holiday\nStayed away from the pyramid board game\nBroke it down to a neighborhood slang\nCash before fame\n\nSky high, sky high\nSky high (Sky high)\nSky high (Sky high)\nSky high (Sky high)\nSky high (Sky high)\n\nNow who done stepped in?\nThe nigga, the B-I-G, the secret weapon, boi\nSlicker than Black Ice, throwin' these flows like rice at weddings\nSo quit flexing, we speakin' about\nSomething that's refreshing to the earlobes\nPay for the room and still be in pimp mode\nLike Iceberg, Chryslers and Buicks\nSome niggas ain't on they jobs so them suckers here to lose it\nAbuse they privileges and now the whole village's been shot to pieces (Pieces)\n'Cause niggas are biting that same stupid shit, I mean that feces\nBoy, don't beep me, if you ain't got no work (Work)\nI'm strictly 'bout these verses like the ones you hear at church, boy, search, boy\nTalking about your dough is long like Lurch, boy\nEvery time I heard you rhymin' like a fucking jerk, boy; simp\nYeah!\n\nFriends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your eardrums\nIt was a beautiful day off in the neighborhood\nYellows and greens and blues and browns\nAnd greys and hues that ooze beneath dilapidated wood\nAin't a thing could explain what pertains\nTo cocaine and sustaining reign\nSee, summer rolls around, niggas holler bout change\nThen they steady move them keys like Bob James\n'Cause old man winter's arrived, the temperature dives\nNovember just died, December's alive\nThus it ain't no typical ride\nJust individuals' way to bring home\nThe bacon when bacon was all gone\nMaking it our own, taking me all wrong\nWe've all indulged in the bulge of those no-nos\nNo, you ain't solo, there's even lower levels you can go\nTake sun people, put 'em in a land of snow\n\nTouch what I never touched before\nSeen what I never seen before\nWoke up and seen the sun\nSky high, sky high",
