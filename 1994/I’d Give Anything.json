 "lyrics": "I'm waiting\nFor someone who could turn my life around\nSomeone who could make me feel\nThe way I used to feel\nBut she never comes\nI'm searching\nBut there's no one that I'd care to talk about\nAnd all the lovers in the world\nDon't amount to much\n'Cause what I really want is just one love\n\nAnd I'd give anything and everything\nTo fall in love\nJust this one time, I'd like to find\nWhat I've been dreaming of\nWell, I could find someone to hold me\nBut that wouldn't be enough\nBut I'd give anything to fall in love\n\nNow I lay here\nI'd rather not be sleeping by myself\nStaring at the wall\nI question it all\nWill she ever come? (Will she ever come?)\nWill she ever come?\n\nAnd I'd give anything and everything\nTo fall in love\nJust this one time, I'd like to find\nWhat I've been dreaming of\nWell, I could find someone to hold me\nBut that wouldn't be enough\nBut I'd give anything to fall in love\n\nI'm gonna keep on making wishes\nI'm gonna keep on being strong\nI won't settle for less than true love at its best\nI'm gonna keep in holding on\nAnd I'd give, oh\n\nI'd give anything and everything\nTo fall in love\nJust this one time, I'd like to find\nWhat I've been dreaming of\nWell, I could find someone to hold me\nBut that wouldn't be enough\nI'd give anything to fall in love\n\nOh, oh, I'd give anything to fall in love\nI wanna fall, I wanna fall in love\nI'd give everything to fall in love",
