 "lyrics": "Touch me tease me\nFill me and caress me\nHold on tight and don't let go\nBaby I'm about to explode\nCause I'm a love you can't control\n\nI waited all this time\nI nearly lost my mind\nI've thought a thousand times\nI hope you fuck just like a star\nBaby that's exactly what you are\nLet's blow some haze a bit\nAin't no relationship\nI ain't faking shit\nSlow to the pace like my guitar\nBaby I can tear you apart\n\nTouch me tease me\nFill me and caress me\nHold on tight and don't let go\nBaby I'm about to explode\nCause I'm a love you can't control\n\nTouch me tease me\nBaby tantalize me\nI just want to fuck you so\nBaby I'm about to explode\nCause I'm a love you can't control\n\nCause I'm a love you can't control\nTouch me tease me\nEvery time our eyes meet\nI just want to fuck some more\nBaby I'm about to explode\nCause I'm a love you can't control",
