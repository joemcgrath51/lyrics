I can't last a day without you\nTogether:\nTrust me when I tell you baby\nTeena:\nBaby, your love is king\nI'll be alright 'til you come back\nBut I wish you'd never leave\nFaith:\nLosing the battle, what's up with my defense?\nTogether:\nCan't last a day without you\nCause I need you baby\n(Chorus)\nDon't need your touch (I don't need your touch)\nDon't need your voice (I don't need your voice)\nDon't need your hands (baby)\nCan't last a day (I can't last a day without you)\nDon't need your arms (your arms)\nYour arms wrapped around me, baby\nDon't need your lovin'\nCan't last a day, can't last a day, can't last a day",
