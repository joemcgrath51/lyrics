(I was ready to go)\nSo many times I... (Had my foot out the door)\nSo many times I...\n(I thought to give him a chance)\n(Thought he'd be a better man)\nNow I'm sitting here and I'm so confused\nCause I keep fighting myself for you\n(I don't know how much more I can take but I can't feel this way)\n(You got me so torn)\n\nTorn in between the two (Oh yeah)\nCause I really wanna be with you (I really wanna be with you)\nBut something's telling me I should leave you alone\nLeave you alone\nLeave you alone (But I don't know)\nAnd you got me just torn in between the two (Should I stay or should I go)\nCause I really wanna be with you (I don't know)\nBut something's telling me I should leave you alone\n(You alone)\nLeave you alone\nLeave you alone. (You alone)\nAnd you got me just torn in between the two (I'm torn in between the two)\nCause I really wanna be with you (I really wanna be with you)\nBut something's telling me I should leave you alone (But I don't know)\nLeave you alone\nLeave you alone\nAnd you got me just torn in between the two\nCause I really wanna be with you\nBut something's telling me I should leave you alone\nLeave you alone\nLeave you alone\nAnd you got me just torn in between the two\nCause I really wanna be with you\nBut something's telling me I should leave you alone\nLeave you alone\nLeave you alone\nAnd you got me just torn in between the two\nCause I really wanna be with you\nBut something's telling me I should leave you alone\nLeave you alone",
