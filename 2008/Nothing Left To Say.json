 "lyrics": "Love was so strong at least in the beginning\nWho would've thought there'd ever be an ending\nWe had it all but it's like we've run into a wall\nNow we try to talk but just end up fighting\nTry making up but there's just no denying\nJust ain't the same no more\nWhat are we putting ourselves through all this for?\n\nYou talk and hear me but you can't communicate\n'Cause you're not listening, know these are two different things\nNow I see what it means to have been blinded by the one you love so deeply\n'Cause\n\nThe very things that made me love you\nAre the things pushing me away, now\nIn tears, we stand here with nothing left to say\nAnd all I could do for you I should've done before now\nIn tears, we stand here\nThere's nothing left to say\n\nYou touched my heart and were so givin'\nSpirit so free, you drew me in and I fell so deep\nI could not see my life without you in it\nGirl, you gave me a lot of attention\nSomehow the feeling turned into crazy possessive\nIt was always there but I didn't look deeper\nIf I would of I'd have seen the limits\n\nYou talk and hear me but you can't communicate\n'Cause you're not listenin', know these are two different things\nNow I see what it means to have been blinded by the one you love so deeply\n\nI had my pride, girl and you had your pain\nSo deep inside you, wanted to have your say\nIrritated, frustrated and hurt\nBaby, this is so confusing\nGirl, I thought this was the real thing for sure\n\nThe very things that made me love you\nAre the things pushing me away, now (Away now)\nIn tears, we stand here with nothing left to say\nAnd all I could do for you (And all I could do for you)\nI should've done before now (Before, oh in tears)\nIn tears, we stand here (Oh)\nThere's nothing left to Say\n\nSayyy-ay-e-ay-ay-ay-ay (Nothin', nothin')\nAyy-e-ayy-ay-ay-ay (Nothin', nothin')\nWish I had more words to try and encourage us to find a way\n'Cause there's nothing left to say\n\nThe very things that made me love you\nAre the things pushing me away now (Pushing me away now, oh)\nIn tears, we stand here (Ooh, ooh, nothing)\nWith nothing left to say\n(And I could do for you)\nAnd all I could do for you\n(I should've done before, it's true)\nI should've done before now\n(Should've done it before, baby, yeah)\nIn tears, we stand here (Ooh, ooh, oh)\nThere's nothing left to say\nThe very things that made me love you (Made me love you)\nAre the things pushing me away, now (Oh, in tears we stand here)\nIn tears, we stand here (Oh, ooh, oh)\nWith nothing left to say (To say-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay)\nAnd all I could do for you (All I could do)\nI should've done before (Yeah)\nIn tears, we stand here (Before)\nThere's nothing left to say (Nothing left to)\nSay-ay-ay-ay-ay\n\nYeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh\nBaby, there's nothin' left to say",
