Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new\nI ain't tryna tell you what to do, but try to play it cool\nBaby, I ain't playing by your rules\nEverything look better with a view\nWhy you always in a mood? Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new\nI ain't tryna tell you what to do, but try to play it cool\nBaby, I ain't playing by your rules\nEverything look better with a view\n\nSo why you tryin' to fake your love on the regular\nWhen you could be blowin' up just like my cellular?\nI won't ever let a shorty go and set me up\nOnly thing I need to know is if you wet enough\nI'm talking slick back, kick back, \ngang sippin' fourties\nYou keep playin', not another day with you, shorty\nMismatched fits, that was way before you know me\nGot a lot of love, well, you better save it for me\n[Pre-Chorus: iann dior, \niann dior & 24kGoldn\n]\nWe play games of love to avoid the depression\nWe been here before and I won't be your victim\n\nWhy you always in a mood? Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new\nI ain't tryna tell you what to do, but try to play it cool\nBaby, I ain't playing by your rules\nEverything look better with a view\nWhy you always in a mood? Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new\nI ain't tryna tell you what to do, but try to play it cool\nBaby, I ain't playing by your rules\nEverything look better with a view, yeah",
