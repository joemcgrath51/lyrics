 "lyrics": "The night gets silent\nOn the tightrope to find my balance\nBut around here\nI can't hear a sound\nThe clocks keep ticking down\nI\u2019ve found myself at the edge of time\nLooking for a new direction of the wind\nAnd a way to leave things behind\nIf this is that broken moment\nI won't let it be stolen\nFrom our souls, oh\n(Chorus):\nThe morning comes to rise\nI feel the sun hitting the ground\nVanishing all the lies, in front of my eyes\nWith no wounds\nI'll face this storm with my own battle scars\nThere are a lot of things\nThey are my fault\nAnd they're keeping me awake at night\nWe walked away\nBut we fell on the lion\u2019s den\nI hope to find ourselves someday\nBut we are tired to do it again\n(Chorus):\nThe morning comes to rise\nI feel the sun hitting the ground\nVanishing all the lies, in front of my eyes\nWith no wounds\nI'll face this storm with my own battle scars\nNow I can feel the thunder\nAnd a feeling under\nIs this some kind of wonder?\n(Chorus):\nThe morning comes to rise\nI feel the sun hitting the ground\nVanishing all the lies, in front of my eyes\nWith no wounds\nI'll face this storm with my own battle scars\nThe night gets silent\nOn the tightrope to find my balance",
