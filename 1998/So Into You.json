 "lyrics": "With every passing moment\nThoughts of you run through my head\nEvery time that I'm near you\nI realize that you're heaven sent\n\nI think you're truly something special\nJust what my dreams are really made of\nLet's stay together you and me boy\nThere's no one like you around\nOh baby\n\nI really like what you've done to me\nI can't really explain it, I'm so into you\nI really like what you've done to me\nI can't really explain it, I'm so into you\n\nIt could be the way that you hold me\nIt could be the things that you say\nOh I'm not too sure what it is boy\nBut I know I like feeling this way\n\nI think you're truly something special\nJust what my dreams are really made of\nLet's stay together you and me boy\nThere's no one like you around\nOh baby\n\nI really like what you've done to me\nI can't really explain it, I'm so into you\nI really like what you've done to me\nI can't really explain it, I'm so into you\nI really like what you've done to me\nI can't really explain it, I'm so into you\nI really like what you've done to me\nI can't really explain it, I'm so into you\n\nI really like\nWhat I feel when I'm with you\nYou're a dream come true\nDon't you ever leave my side\n'Cause it feels so right\n\nI really like what you've done to me\nI can't really explain it, I'm so into you\nI really like what you've done to me\nI can't really explain it, I'm so into you\nI really like what you've done to me\nI can't really explain it, I'm so into you\nI really like what you've done to me\nI can't really explain it, I'm so into you\nI'm so into you\nI'm so into you\nOh, I'm so into you",
