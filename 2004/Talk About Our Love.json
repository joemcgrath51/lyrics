 "lyrics": "What ya hear this time?\nGo on and speak your mind\nI know somebody's lying\nIt's always somethin'\nHer auntie told your cousin\nThen all your homies jumped in\nAnd now the whole hoods buzzin'\nHe said, she said\nDon't let it get in ya head\nBaby, don't say\nSomething that you will regret\nI'm on your team\nIt's us against them you'll see\nHey, we ain't gon stop\nThey just want what we got\n\nThe more they talk about our love\nThe more they make it obvious\nThe more they seem so envious\nHow can they talk about our love\nWhen they don't know one thing about us\nInstead they just runnin they mouths\nSo all we do is tune them out\n\nI swear they got some nerve\nSpreadin' what they heard\nI can't give them no burn\nI can't be concerned with all that talk\nI won't be involved\nThat's my word\nSee, I'm not the one\nThey got me confused\nThey got me messed up\nDon't you think I've had enough\nWhen it comes to what we do\nAll that matters is us two\nDon't pay them no mind\nWe just gon show and prove\n\nThe more they talk about our love\nThe more they make it obvious\nThe more they seem so envious\nHow can they talk about our love (You're talkin' about me)\nWhen they don't know one thing about us\nInstead they just runnin they mouths\nSo all we do is tune them out\n\nHeres a couple of things I can't honor man\nHow you listen to a girl that still wanna man\nTell me the truth is that a man or Juwanna Man\nI'm wonderin why she ret ta go like Wanda then\nWhen we met you was a V like Madonna, man\nNow you in the field, runnin' plays like Donovan\nMcNabb before you get in a cab\nI trade in my cash\nJust to take you back to last summer, man\nYou don't remember when you was my sweetest\nYou don't remember I called you Reese's Pieces\n'Cause it's no wrong way to do you know what\nShe turned around, giggled, said \"You so nuts!\"\nBut nowadays we actin' way too grown up\nLike how ya ex girl get that new number\nThe rumors was so numerous\nFor sticking' by me, I had to give you two thumbs up\nAnd that's why\n\nThe more they talk about our love\nThe more they make it obvious\nThe more they seem so envious\nHow can they talk about our love\nWhen they don't know one thing about us\nInstead they just runnin they mouths\nSo all we do is tune them out\n\nThe more they talk about our love\nThe more they make it obvious\nThe more they seem so envious\nHow can they talk about our love (Let's not talk about it)\nWhen they don't know one thing about us?\nInstead they just runnin' they mouths\nSo all we do is tune them out\nI don't wanna hear it no more",
