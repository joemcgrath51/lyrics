You know John and what it is\nBut then again too many yes-men...\n(Wyclef: \"Yo John, they missed it.\")\nHustle big, hustle small\nAll y'all relate to it\nI'm a a culture power, baby, when I slide right through it\nWhat the biz, money? You know John and what it is\nThen again too many yes-men inside the business\nWe stay grungy\nRisk take on streets like a bungee\nHoes get nothing from me\nI'm-a die feeling hungry\nRappers too complacent\nI make hits in the basement\nGot all the men on top wondering where they placement\nIf it's real, then it's real\nAnd it ain't no replacement\nThem jealous cats who talk need to all walk adjacent\nI trifold y'all all into a image my mold\nSo I can teach you how to walk, eat, drink, and buy gold\nMy shit is iz-ill\nWear three condoms out in Brazil\nBrothers from the 'ville no fault at the iz-ill\nWanna have a duke? Get real! How you fiz-eel?\nYou couldn't stick me if you brought the chisel\nWhat the diz-eal?\nEat four stars at every miz-eal\nYou kiz-ill the vibe\nYou just high from the twiz-ill\nAnd sti-zill I flow riz-ill, leave you fiz-ill\nAnd leave y'all all stuck like Jack from without the Jiz-ill\nWhat?\n\nMe and my crew in a little tour show\nLearned to flip the door with the money we've got\n(Make the money)\nThe blocks stay hot, getting knocked it's on\nTill one by one, we were gone\n(I'm gone)\nSubway sparks after dark\nFlash the message: something's out there\n(Suicide. It's a suicide. Parappa!)\nFlash the message: something's out there\n\nI shoot the gift cop\nFind John at the strip spot\nJuggling three who all know to keep their lips locked\nI don't get got\nI told y'all before: it's hot\nFuck the floss\nI'm the boss when I rock flip-flops\nCulture hip-hop\nBefore I take your head you should skip bop\nOr find us in your homes with the chrome and the shits cocked\nWhat?\nHey y'all pose hard, but they rip up\nI leave them enemies with their lips shut\nDid what?\nYo money ease up how you cease us\nYou better off reefin' lighting trees up\nSmoking with your mens fantasizing something swiftly\nBut little did you know I had the whole country with me\n\nLittle do you know (3x)\nI got the whole country with me\nLittle do you know, huh?\n\n\n\nRefugee Camp All-stars\nDirty Cash, C.O., Wyclef Jean\nNutzbaby, Nutzbaby\nJohn Fort\u00e9, where you at baby?\nCome on",
