 "lyrics": "I'm going back to the day we parted\nAnd all the ways you were broken-hearted\nI take a trip every day in my mind\nI see your face, I recall a few words\nIt's playing back like a broken record\nI remember every tear in your eyes\n\nIf I knew what I know\nI'd walk back in time\nI would right every wrong\nI would change every line\nThen you'd be here right now\nJust like yesterday\nBut you'd feel no more doubt\nWhen you hear me say\n\nYou're the only one I want\nYou're the only one I need in my life\nYou're the only one I love\nYou're the only one I need in my life\n\nI see the world through a haze of memories\nOther girls don't mean a damn thing to me\nIt's kind of sad how they just don't compare\nTime will tell, let's wait and see\nIf the love we have was meant to be\nCause I know we've got a future out there\n\nCause you're still my girl\nI don't care what they say\nLet's go back to our world\nBaby, don't you throw this love away\nCause I still believe\nIn the magic of us\nIt's just a matter of time\nAnd it's a matter of trust\n\n\nNow girl it took some time\nTo get real with myself\nNow love ain't easy sometimes\nBut when you find it, let's stay together",
