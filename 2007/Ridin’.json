(Oh, I'm)\n\nI'm ridin', I'm ridin' past your momma's house\nYou got me ridin', I'm ridin' past your boy's house\nYou got me ridin', I'm ridin', I'm ridin' trying to find you\nBoy, you got me out here looking for you (I'm)\nI'm ridin', I'm ridin' past that bitch's house\nYou got me ridin', I'm ridin' by all your ex's house\nYou got me ridin', I'm ridin', I'm ridin' trying to find you\nBaby, you got me out here looking for you (I'm)\n\nIt's three in the morning\nIt's four in the morning\nIt's five in the morning\nWhere ya at, where ya at, where ya at?\nIt's three in the morning\nIt's four in the morning\nIt's five in the morning\nWhere ya at, where ya at, where ya at?",
