Can we just talk?\nTalk about where we're goin'\nBefore we get lost, lend me your thoughts\nCan't get what we want without knowin'\nI've never felt like this before\nI apologize if I'm movin' too far\nCan we just talk? Can we just talk?\nFigure out where we're goin'\n\nYeah, started off right\nI can see it in your eyes\nI can tell that you're wantin' more\nWhat's been on your mind?\nThere's no reason we should hide\nTell me somethin' I ain't heard before\n\nOh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it\nAnd it's you I'm on\nSo stop thinkin' 'bout it\n\nCan we just talk? Can we just talk?\nTalk about where we're goin'\nBefore we get lost, lend me your thoughts (Yeah)\nCan't get what we want without knowin' (No)\nI've never felt like this before\nI apologize if I'm movin' too far\nCan we just talk? Can we just talk?\nFigure out where we're goin'\n\nOh, nah\nPenthouse view, left some flowers in the room\nI'll make sure I leave the door unlocked\nNow I'm on the way, swear I won't be late\nI'll be there by five o'clock\n\nOh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it\nAnd I'm what you want\nSo stop thinkin' 'bout it\n\nCan we just talk? (Oh) Can we just talk?\nTalk about where we're goin'\nBefore we get lost, lend me your thoughts\nCan't get what we want without knowin'\nI've never felt like this before\nI apologize if I'm movin' too far\nCan we just talk? Can we just talk?\nFigure out where we're goin'\n\nFigure out where we're goin'",
