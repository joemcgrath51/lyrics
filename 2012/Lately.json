 "lyrics": "I can't imagine life\nWithout you by my side\nThis is love that I'm feeling\nI'm hoping you're feeling the same\nThings tend to slip my mind\nLike how you love to wine and dine me, baby\n(I know romance is important)\nImportant to the way that we feel\nHave I told you I love you lately?\nHave I told you that you mean the world to me lately?\nHave I told you I love you?\nI'll be your wishing well\nTell me what you want\n\nDon't you think twice about my love\nI say these things because\nBecause I love you baby\nBut it's hard to explain\nI'm hoping you feeling the same\nYou know all that I feel inside\nVerbally, I tend to hide, baby baby\nSometimes I tend to forget\nHow much L-O-V-E really means\n\n\nYou try your hardest to deal, my baby\nBut I forgot about... I just forgot how I feel\nThings slip my mind, oh, and that's a fact\nTell me that you love me\nWatch me tell you right back",
