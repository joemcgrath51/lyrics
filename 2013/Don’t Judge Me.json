Was she an actress?\"\nBaby, the fact is\n\nYou're hearing rumors about me and saw some pictures online\nSaying they got you so angry, making you wish you were blind\nBefore we start talking crazy, saying some things we'll regret\nCan we just slow it down and press reset? (Damn)\nYou're beautiful, so baby\n\n(So baby)\nSo please don't judge me and I won't judge you\n'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful\nPlease don't judge me and I won't judge you\nAnd if you love me, then let it be beautiful\n\nJust let the past, just be the past\nAnd focused on things that are gonna make us laugh\nTake me as I am (Take me as I am) and not who I was (Not who I was)\nI'll promise I'll be the one that you can trust, so please\n[Chorus: Chris Brown, \nwith Sevyn Streeter\n]\nSo \nplease don't judge me\n (Don't judge me)\nAnd I won't judge you\n (And I won't 'cause)\n'Cause \nit could get ugly\n before it gets beautiful\nSo \nplease don't judge me\n and I won't judge you (No, I won't)\nAnd \nif you love me\n (If you love me), then \nlet it be beautiful\n, babe\n[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & \nSevyn Streeter\n]\nLet it be beautifu-u-ul (\nOh\n, ooh)\nLet it be beautiful (\nLet it\n)\nLet it be, oh\nLet it be beautiful, ayy\nLet it be beautiful\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n[Outro: Chris Brown, \nSevyn Streeter\n & \nBoth\n]\nI don't wanna go there\n, baby (\nBe there\n)\nWe should never go there (\nOh\n)",
