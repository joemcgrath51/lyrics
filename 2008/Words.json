 "lyrics": "I believe that, heaven must be like this\nRay of sunshine kissed upon your skin\nJust say you love me, make my day go good\nPot of gold at the end of a rainbow\n\nCan't tell you nothin' you ain't already heard\nNo matter what I say it's nothin' but words\nJust let me prove to you what I know is real\nLet me express to you the way that I feel\n\nI believe that love is synonymous\nWith heaven, such a sensual bliss\nThe way you touch me, makes this life so good\nA reward at the end of the long road\n\nCan't tell you nothin' you ain't already heard\nNo matter what I say it's nothin' but words\nJust let me prove to you what I know is real\nLet me express to you the way that I feel\n\nFairytales can be real if you just believe\nGot my mind made, I don't plan to leave\nCause you were made for me, simple that may be\nWhy be complex, lovin' you is so easy\n[Chorus: Anthony David & India.Arie, (\nIndia.Arie\n)]\nCan't tell you nothin' you ain't already heard\nNo matter what I say it's nothin' but words\nJust let me prove to you what I know is real\nLet me express to you the way that I feel\nCan't tell you nothin' you ain't already heard\nNo matter what I say it's nothin' but words\nJust let me prove to you what I know is real\nLet me express to you the way that I feel\nCan't tell you nothin' (\nI ain't already heard\n)\nNo matter what I say (\nit's nothin' but words\n)\nJust let me prove to you what I know is real\nLet me express to you the way that I feel",
