 "lyrics": "I was rolling in my car when I pulled up at the mall\nCouldn't find a place to park, threw my keys to the valet\nI was only there to hang, wasn't lookin' for a thing\nI was just about to bounce and then I saw Miss. Lady\nThen I said to myself\n\nThere goes my baby, there goes my destiny\nOnliest one for me, there go my baby\nThere goes my lady, she gon' be the one\nWe gon' fall in love, we gonna have some babies\n\nShe was coming out the shoe store, pretty little thing\nA couple of bags in her hand right in front of Macy's\nAnd then I saw her at the food court sipping lemonade\nConversating on her cell phone, looking so amazing\nAnd I said to myself\n\n\nShe gon' wear my ring, she gon' take my name\nTake her to the cookout, me and her gon' hang\nTake her to my mama house, \nmeet Smokey and them\nIf she need her hair done see my cousin Carol\nI'll treat her like a queen, give her everything\nShe will be my girl till we old and gray\nAnd I knew it from the moment\nThat I saw her lovely, lovely face\n\n\nI love the way you smile, I love it when you walk\nWhen you talk me it makes me so\nCrazy, crazy, crazy, it's blowing my mind\nThat you give me some of your time",
