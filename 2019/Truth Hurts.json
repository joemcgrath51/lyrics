('Til they gotta be great)\nDon't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)\nBest friend sat me down in the salon chair (Down in the salon chair)\nShampoo press, get you out of my hair\nFresh photos with the bomb lighting (With the bomb lighting)\nNew man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)\nTruth hurts, needed something more exciting (Yee)\nBom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay (Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\nYou tried to break my heart?\nOh, that breaks my heart\nThat you thought you ever had it\nNo, you ain't from the start\nHey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch\nI mean, who would wanna hide this?\nI will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick\nI put the sing in single\nAin't worried 'bout a ring on my finger\nSo you can tell your friend, \"Shoot your shot\" when you see him\nIt's okay, he already in my DMs\n\nWhy men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)\nDon't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)\nBest friend sat me down in the salon chair (Down in the salon chair)\nShampoo press, get you out of my hair\nFresh photos with the bomb lighting (With the bomb lighting)\nNew man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)\nTruth hurts, needed something more exciting (Yee)\nBom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay (Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\nI'ma hit you back in a minute (Yeah, yeah)\nI don't play tag, bitch, I been it (One time)\nWe don't fuck with lies (Two times), we don't do goodbyes (Woo)\nWe just keep it pushing like ay-ay-ay\nI'ma hit you back in a minute (Yeah, yeah)\nI don't play tag, bitch, I been it (One time)\nWe don't fuck with lies (Two times), we don't do goodbyes (Woo)\nWe just keep it pushing like ay-ay-ay (Woo)\n\nWhy men great 'til they gotta be great?
