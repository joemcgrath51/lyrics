 "lyrics": "I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed\nGet along with the voices inside of my head\nYou're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath\nAnd you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy\n\nI wanted the fame but not the cover of \nNewsweek\nOh well, guess beggars can't be choosey\nWanted to receive attention for my music\nWanted to be left alone in public, excuse me\nFor wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways\nFame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated\nWhen I blew, see,\n \nbut it was confusing\n'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf\nAbused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam\nWhoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee\nBut with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet\nIt was like winnin' a used mink\nIronic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink\nI'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep\nGoin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith\nBut I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm\u2014\n\nI'm friends with the monster that's under my bed\nGet along with the voices inside of my head\nYou're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath\nAnd you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy\nWell, that's nothin'\n \n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\nWell, that's nothin'\n \n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\n\nNow, I ain't much of a poet\nBut I know somebody once told me to seize the moment\nAnd don't squander it\n \n'cause you never know when it all\nCould be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'\nSometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from\nYeah, ponderin'll do you wonders\nNo wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders\nYodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!\n \nI think it went wanderin' off down yonder\nAnd stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen\n'Cause I need an interventionist\nTo intervene between me and this monster\nAnd save me from myself and all this conflict\n'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it\nMy OCD's conkin' me in the head,\n \nkeep knockin'\nNobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'\nI'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'\nDon't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the\u2014\n\nI'm friends with the monster that's under my bed\nGet along with the voices inside of my head\nYou're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath\nAnd you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy\nWell, that's nothin'\n \n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\nWell, that's nothin'\n \n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\n\nCall me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that\nI'll walk amongst you a regular civilian\nBut until then, drums get killed and\nI'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and\nI'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track\nGive every kid who got played that\n \npumped-up feelin'\nAnd shit to say back to the kids who played him\nI ain't here to save the fuckin' children\nBut if one kid out of a hundred million\nWho are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!\nIt's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back\nIn the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that\nStraw into gold, chump, I will spin\u2014Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack\nMaybe I need a straightjacket\nFace facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!\nIt's nothin', I'm still friends with the\u2014\n\nI'm friends with the monster that's under my bed\nGet along with the voices inside of my head\nYou're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath\nAnd you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy\n\nI'm friends with the monster that's under my bed\n(Get along with) Get along with the voices inside of my head\n(You're tryin' to) You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath\n(And you think) And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy\nWell, that's nothin'\n\n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\nWell, that's nothin'\n \n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)\n(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)",
