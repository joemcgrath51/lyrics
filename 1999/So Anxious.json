 "lyrics": "Nine o' clock, home alone, paging you\nWishing you'd come over, my place, after while, let me know\nWe can just keep talking 'bout the last time, you were here\nWhat we did (no sleep till morning)\nOnly bubble baths and back rubs\nHit me back, girl I hope, you hurry cause\n\nI'm so anxious\nSo meet me at 11:30, I love the way you're talkin' dirty\nSaid, I'm so anxious\nGirl could you quit this stallin', you know I'm a sexaholic\n\nIt's 10:10, where you been?\nDid you get my message?\n(Your expression is telling me that you've been thinkin' the same thang)\nThe same thang I've been thinkin'\nYou say you're working\nWell hit me just as soon as your shift is over\nAnd I'll be waiting, cause I can't sleep for reminiscing\nReminiscing about you and what we do, Hit me back\nOoooohh (And hope you hurry)\n\nI'm so anxious\nSo meet me at 11:30, I love the way you're talkin' dirty\nSaid, I'm so anxious\nGirl could you quit this stallin', you know I'm a sexaholic\nI'm so anxious\nSo meet me at 11:30, I love the way you're talkin' dirty\nSaid, I'm so anxious\nGirl could you quit this stallin', you know I'm a sexaholic\n\nSaid as soon as you hit the door, I'mma pull you down on the floor\nAnd before we get to touch the bed, Baby back up every word you said\nAnd before we, got to hit the lights\nAnd before we start the cande lights\nBaby girl, I wanna bump and grind\nThis is something that's been on my mind\n\nI'm so anxious\nSo meet me at 11:30, I love the way you're talkin' dirty\nSaid, I'm so anxious\nGirl could you quit this stallin', you know I'm a sexaholic\nI'm so anxious\nSo meet me at 11:30, I love the way you're talkin' dirty\nSaid, I'm so anxious\nGirl could you quit this stallin', you know I'm a sexaholic\n\nI'm so anxious\nSo meet me at 11:30, I love the way you're talkin' dirty\nSaid, I'm so anxious",
