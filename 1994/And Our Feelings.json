 "lyrics": "We fell in love\nAnd who could blame us\nThe word was we were just beside ourselves\nAnd everybody said it wouldn't last\nAnd now they wonder\nWhy we didn't last\nWe fell in love\nIt seemed so righteous\nCouldn't compare our love to no one else\nAnd everybody thought we could not win\nIt's no wonder\nLove came to an end\n\nAnd our feelings\nJust aren't feelings anymore\nThey're just words that come from whispers\nFrom people we don't know\nAnd our feelings, yeah\nJust aren't feelings anymore\nThey're just words without emotion\nFrom people who don't know\nWho don't know...\n\nWe fell apart\nThe bond was broken\nShould've kept our thoughts between ourselves\nAnd though they say they cared\nThey didn't help\nMakes me wonder\nShould we blame ourselves?\nSo here we are\nBroken hearted\nWhat in the world have we done to ourselves?\nWhen everybody says to let it end, baby\nWell, it makes me wonder\nWe can't let them win\n\nAnd our feelings\nJust aren't feelings anymore\nThey're just words that come from whispers\nFrom people we don't know\nAnd our feelings\nJust aren't feelings anymore\nThey're just words without emotion\nFrom people who don't know\n\nIf we'd only just try, we could make it by\nAnd maybe in time we could make it right\nIf we only had done what we shoulda done\nWe'd both be here still making love\nI wanna know that, that we can go back\nBack to the times when the lovin' was all that\nWhen no one could come between our love\n\nAnd our feelings\nJust aren't feelings anymore\nThey're just words that come from whispers\nFrom people we don't know\nAnd our feelings\nJust aren't feelings anymore\nThey're just words without emotion\nFrom people who don't know\nAnd our feelings\nJust aren't feelings anymore\nThey're just words that come from whispers\nFrom people we don't know\nAnd our feelings\nJust aren't feelings anymore\nThey're just words without emotion\nFrom people who don't know",
