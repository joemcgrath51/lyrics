Blige, enjoy the sea flow\nPull your hair and your waist, tonight\u2019s the night history is taking place\nAnd you about to come there will be no escape, let it drizzle on down\nRivers till we drown\n\nBaby tonight\u2019s the night I let you know\nBaby tonight\u2019s the night we lose control\nBaby tonight you need that, tonight believe that\nTonight I\u2019ll be the best you ever had\nI don\u2019t wanna brag\nBut I\u2019ll be the best you ever had\nI don\u2019t wanna brag\nBut I\u2019ll be the best you ever had\n\nFantasies fulfill, tell me what you like\nSome morphine, I see, and some candlelight\nMaybe some Berry White, gotta set the mood right\nAnd we can sex under the moonlight for two nights straight\nThis ain\u2019t our first date and even if it was, it would have to be fate\nLay back, relax, let a young nigga learn you\nSo I can read your mind and know what page to turn to\nFirst you was shy, then you was a virgin\nYou\u2019re body\u2019s 25 but your mind is still searching\nFirst was just flirting, now we in the bed with closed curtains\nAnd every time we burst off, destroy it\n\nBaby tonight\u2019s the night I let you know\nBaby tonight\u2019s the night we lose control\nBaby tonight you need that, tonight believe that\nTonight I\u2019ll be the best you ever had\nI don\u2019t wanna brag\nBut I\u2019ll be the best you ever had\nI don\u2019t wanna brag\nBut I\u2019ll be the best you ever had",
