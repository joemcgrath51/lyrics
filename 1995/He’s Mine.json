 "lyrics": "He might be doing you\nBut he's thinking about me\nSo baby, think about another lover\nAnd go find another brother\nI know he's my man\nHe's all in my hands\nIt feels good when he calls my name\nDon't you wish you had the same?\nFeeling disgust working your stuff\nUntil he thinks about mine\nNow he's feeling real high\nYou ask why 'cause he's mine\nTell you something\nThat just ain't cool\nNever fall in love with a man\nWho don't love you\nI wouldn't waste my time\nTelling something wrong\nYou've been with him one night\nAnd now he's coming home\n\nHe's mine\nYou may have had him once\nBut I got him all the time\n(You can't sleep at night)\nHe's mine\nYou may of had him once\nBut I got him all the time\n(Don't try to dry your eyes)\nHe's mine\nYou may of had him once\nBut I got him all the time\n(I got him all the time)\n\nWent out on a date\nWasn't out too late\nTook you to a room\nAnd you gave it up too soon\nPlayed you like a trick\n'Cuz you let him hit\nNow he's coming home to a lover\nThat is strong\nI got all his love, baby, don't try to take it\nYou wanted a piece, you were mistaken\n'Cuz he belongs to me\nBaby, can't you see?\nI tell you something that just ain't cool\nNever fall in love with a man\nWho don't love you\nI wouldn't waste my time\nTelling you something wrong\nYou've been with him one night\nAnd now he's coming home\n\n\nWe don't have time\nPlaying these games\nYou had him once\nBut it's me on his mind\nNo need to cry\nGo dry your eyes\nGet over it\nIt was only for one night, ohh",
