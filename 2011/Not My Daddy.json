You're my man\nI think it's time you understand\nSo just make me happy if you can (Oh)\nI'm not your mama, I'm your girl\nAnd I am the lady in your world\nAnd loving each other's how we work. (Oh)\n\nTrust. Without it there's no love\nIt's true no matter what you try\nUs, there can be no us\nUnless we find the strength to fight\n\nI spy, you seek. You watch, I peek. So what are we doin' with our love? It's not how it's posed' to be\n\nYou're not my daddy. You're my man\nI think it's time you understand\nSo just make me happy if you can (Oh)\nI'm not your mama, I'm your girl\nAnd I am the lady in your world\nAnd loving each other's how we work. (Oh)\n\nSure, are we really sure?\nMaybe we should close the door\nOh, the storms, we try to stand the storms\nWe've been holdin' on too long\n\nI pray, you weep. You cry, I speak. See, what are we doin' with our love? It's not how posed' to be\n\nYou're not my daddy. You're my man\nI think it's time you understand\nSo just make me happy if you can (Oh)\nI'm not your mama, I'm your girl\nAnd I am the lady in your world\nAnd loving each other's how we work. (Oh)\n\nOoh, please, come to me with sweet words like when we met. Ooh, screams. Yells & screams. Change the language that we talkin'. I'll just get to walkin'. Baby, Baby!\n\nYou're not my daddy. You're my man\nI think it's time you understand\nSo just make me happy if you can (Oh)\nI'm not your mama, I'm your girl\nAnd I am the lady in your world\nAnd loving each other's how we work. (Oh)\nYou're not my daddy. You're my man. \nYou're not my daddy, you're my...",
