 "lyrics": "Boy, I saw you soon as you came bouncin' through the door\nYou, and your mans, and them just took over the floor\nStarted doing your thing\nAnd it made me notice you even more\nThe way you turned around and looked at me seemed as though\nYou must've somehow felt me staring on the low\nSomething tells me you're the kind of guy I'd like to get to know\n\nI ain't even gonna front\nI ain't even gonna lie\nSince you walked up in the club\nI've been giving you the eye\nWe can dance if you want\nGet it crackin' if you like\nMust be a full moon\nFeel like one of those nights\n\nWhy is this the first time that I'm seeing you around?\nCould you be visiting, or are you new in town?\nYeah, whatever the case\nI'm feeling you right here and right now\nYour smile and all the love you showing lets me know that you\nLike what you see and wanna get to know me too\nThis could very well be the start of something special\nHappy that I met you\n\nI ain't even gonna front\nI ain't even gonna lie\nSince you walked up in the club\nI've been giving you the eye (Giving you the eye)\nWe can dance if you want  (Dance if you want)\nGet it crackin' if you like (Crackin' if you like)\nMust be a full moon (A full moon)\nFeel like one of those nights\nI ain't even gonna front (Even gonna front)\nI ain't even gonna lie (Even gonna lie)\nSince you walked up in the club (Walked up in the club)\nI've been giving you the eye (Giving you the eye)\nWe can dance if you want (Whoa, oh)\nGet it crackin' if you like (Crackin' if you like)\nMust be a full moon\nFeel like one of those nights\n\nI didn't think that I'd come here tonight\nMeet someone like you\nStart feeling the way I do\nSeems like we've known each other most of our lives\nAfter one conversation, this must be right\n\nI ain't even gonna front (Even gonna front)\nI ain't even gonna lie (Ooh, baby)\nSince you walked up in the club (Hey, yeah)\nI've been giving you the eye\nWe can dance if you want\nGet it crackin' if you like\nMust be a full moon\nFeel like one of those nights (Oh)\nI ain't even gonna front\nI ain't even gonna lie (I ain't even gonna lie)\nSince you walked up in the club\nI've been giving you the eye (Whoa, oh)\nWe can dance if you want (Whoa, oh)\nGet it crackin' if you like (Whoa, oh)\nMust be a full moon (Whoa, oh)\nFeel like one of those nights\nI ain't even gonna front (Even gonna front)\nI ain't even gonna lie (Even gonna lie)\nSince you walked up in the club (Walked up in the club)\nI've been giving you the eye (Giving you the eye)\nWe can dance if you want (Dance if you want)\nGet it crackin' if you like (Crackin' if you like)\nMust be a full moon\nFeel like one of those nights (One of those nights)",
