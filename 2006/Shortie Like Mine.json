and it's hard to find\nAnother shorty like mine (Uh-huh), baby, yes, I'm\nAddicted to how we kick it, everything you say to me (This is going out to all the shorties around the world)\nNever knew it could be so wicked, hoping that you stay with me\nSearch around the world but you will never find (Uh)\nAnother shorty like mine (C'mon), shorty like mine\nI tell my niggas that uh you got a girl but she ain't nothing like mine (Uh)\nCute face nice size like mine\nStay kitted, hood with like mine (Ha)\nMean walk, talk the talk, let me tell you some more (Woo)\n\nI knew that when I ran into this
