 "lyrics": "You said when the storm came\nThat you would be there with your umbrella to block the rain\nAnd you said you'd protect me\nFrom heartache, pain, lies, loneliness, and misery\nYou said you'll tear down the walls\nThat were in the way\nYou promised things would be okay\nAnd I stood there in the freezing cold\nAnd I waited for ya, but you never showed\n\nWhere you at? \nBoy you say you would be here for me\nWhere you at \n\nNow you said you'll go to church\nStop the slanging, find a real job and go to work\nAnd you say you'd stay out the streets\nAnd spend more time with me\nTake away my doubt and fears\nAnd fulfill my dreams\nYou said you'd be the shoulder for my eyes to cry on\nSaid you would be the one that I could depend on\nAnd I stood there in the freezing cold\nAnd I waited for ya, but you never showed, boy\n\nWhere you at \nBoy you say you would be here for me\nWhere you at \n\nAnd those false promises is much like fake names\nYou painted a picture for me but there was no frame\nYou made my future look bright and I believed every word\nI went to sleep on the cloud and woke up in the dirt\nAnd now I'm without shelter and the wind is blowing\nYou said you'd be there for me boy when the tough got going\nSaid if weapons formed you'd stand in front of me\nWhen ever I felt trapped\nSaid you'd be the one to set me free\nThought you were my hero\nBut as it turned out you were no show\n\nTell me where you at\nOh, you said you'd be there for me\nWhere you at \nYou said you'd be right there for me\nAnd I can't see, see, see, see\nYou said you'd be there for me\nSo I'm waiting on ya right here until you appear and\nDeliver deliver boy deliver",
