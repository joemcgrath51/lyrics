 "lyrics": "Love come quick\nLove come in a hurry\nThere are thieves in the temple tonight\n\nThey don't care where they kick\nJust as long as they hurt you\nThere are thieves in the temple tonight\nLove if you're there come save me\nFrom all this cold despair\nI can hang when you're around\nBut I'll surely die\nIf you're not there\n\nLove come quick\nLove come in a hurry\nThere are thieves in the temple tonight\n\nI feel like I'm looking for my soul (Soul)\nLike a poor man looking for gold (Gold)\nThere are thieves in the temple tonight\nVoices from the sky say rely on your best friend to pull you through\nBut even if I wanted to I couldn't really truly because my only friend is you\nCome on\n\nThere are thieves in the temple tonight\n\nKicking me in my heart, tearing me all apart\n(Tearing me, tearing me, tearing me all apart)\nBecause me and you could have been a work of art\nThieves in the temple\nBaby don't you know I'm holding on\nThe best that I can\nLove please help me be\nThe better man\nBetter than the thieves in the temple\nIn the temple tonight\nOh, thieves in the temple (Tonight) tonight\nHurt me\n\nLove come quick\nLove come in a hurry\nThere are thieves in the temple tonight\nThieves in the temple\n\nYou said you loved me! (Thieves in the temple)\nYou said I was your friend! (Thieves in the temple)\nYou were supposed to take care of me! (Love come quick) {Thieves in the temple}\nYou lie! Love come (Lie!) in a hurry (Lie!)\nThieves in the temple",
