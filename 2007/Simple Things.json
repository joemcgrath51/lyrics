My Wheels With The Lover That Meant Me No Good\nLoosing My Breath In The Hustle\nJust Stressin' Over Nuthin'\nForgetting The Real Pleasures That Lie - In The Simple Things\n\nThe Sun Shining On My Face - Your Strong Embrace\nMama Calling - Daddy Calling To See If I'm Ok\nThe Fresh Air I Breathe - Enough Food To Eat\nA Warm Place To Sleep At Night - Are The Simple Things",
