 "lyrics": "We don't have to worry bout no money, to have us a real good time\nAnd we don't have to leave in the morning, the whole day just you and I\nAnd it don't have to get any better, it's perfect you in my life\nIf you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool\nWe don't have to worry 'bout no groceries, we can fill up on love alone\nIf we ain't got enough for a movie, we can just sit at home\nHave a little role play baby, whatever turns you on\nIf you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool\nIf you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool\nQuit your worrying baby\nQuit your worrying girl\nQuit your crying lady\nWe can conquer the world\nPack a li'l love for the evening, let me hold you tight\nDon't be worried about my problems believe me- everything's gonna be alright\nWe can shoot for the moon watch some cartoons, whatever makes you smile\nIf you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool\nIf you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool\nQuit your worrying baby (Oh you forget about your problems tonight)\nQuit your worrying girl (You ain't never gotta worry about a thing now)\nQuit your crying lady (Quit your crying baby)\nWe can conquer the world (We can conquer anything together)\nAin't nobody worried 'bout no money, and we still gonna have a good time\nLike JJ, Thelma, and Willona, we gonna have a good time\nWe can take a stroll in the park, holding hands walking side by side\nDrop the top down on the 'lac, feel the breeze and take a li'l ride\nYou know I love the southern stuff baby\nFish and chicken with the hot fries\nAnd we a perfect match, I'm the ham and you the good collard greens on the side\nDon't worry girl\nDon't worry.. No\nWe're alright\nHold On, Hold On\nQuit your worrying baby\nQuit your worrying girl\nQuit your crying lady\nWe can conquer the world\nWe can conquer the world",
