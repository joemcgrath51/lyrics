 "lyrics": "I've never been down for the kiss and tell\nAnd I realize that you don't know me well\nI'm talkin' 'bout grown things\nDon't let the words get in the way\nI know that you heard all about my past\nAnd all the relationships that didn't last\nBut we do what we gonna do\nThere's something I must get straight, baby\n\nSee, what we do here stays here\nI'm telling you 'cause I wanna make it clear\nIt's only 'cause I want you to have no fear\nThat baby, what we do here stays here\nAnd nobody has to know\nWhat's good is if you meet me right after the show\nI'm telling you \u2018cause I wanna make it clear\nThat baby, what we do here stays here\n\nIf you have any questions, girl, go on and ask\nRight now while your reputation's still in tact\nTen minutes 'til curtain call\nEverything will be okay\nI swear this has never happened once before\nChances are you won't get back once you're out that door\nYour body's telling me yes\nYou can believe me when I say\n\nSee, what we do here stays here\nI'm telling you 'cause I wanna make it clear\nIt's only 'cause I want you to have no fear\nThat baby, what we do here stays here\nAnd nobody has to know\nWhat's good is if you meet me right after the show\nI'm telling you \u2018cause I wanna make it clear\nThat baby, what we do here stays here\n\nIt's almost time to start the show\nI don't want you to go\nI want you stay, I'll say it again\n'Cause I need you so\n\nWhat we do here stays here\nI'm telling you 'cause I wanna make it clear\nIt's only 'cause I want you to have no fear\nThat baby, what we do here stays here, yeah\nAnd nobody has to know\nWhat's good is if you meet me right after the show\nI'm telling you \u2018cause I wanna make it clear\nThat baby, what we do here stays here\nWhat we do here stays here\nI'm telling you 'cause I wanna make it clear\nIt's only 'cause I want you to have no fear\nThat baby, what we do here stays here\nAnd nobody has to know\nWhat's good is if you meet me right after the show\nI'm telling you \u2018cause I wanna make it clear\nThat baby, what we do here stays here",
