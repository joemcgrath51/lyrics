Hey, hey\nUp all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Oh, yeah, yeah\nBaby when we gon' slide, slide, slide, slide?\nSlide, uh\n\nI don't care if we on the run\nNothin' matters when we one on one\nLookin' at us 'cause we goin' dumb\nWe on the same wave, you the same way\nYou know I be down if it's with you\nWhere we goin'? Baby, what's the move?\nWe should take a trip up to the moon\nGet a room\n[Chorus: H.E.R. & \nYG\n]\nDoin' our thing, movin' too fast\nCandy paint with the windows all black\nSeats cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, what they gon' say?\nWith the top down screamin', \"Money ain't a thing\"\nAnd we up 'til six in the mornin'\nWhen the sun rise, we be on it\nOoh, I got five, you know it's all live\nTell me when to go, baby, when we gon' slide?\nBaby, when we gon' slide? Hey, huh\nUp all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Yeah\nUp all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Oh\nUp all night, baby, when we gon' slide?
