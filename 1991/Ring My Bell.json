 "lyrics": "Yo, baby, you know what's up\nGirl, you can call me up\nAnd you an' I can talk for hours and hours at a time\nThis as an invitation\nTo a conversation\nSo when things get bad you know I'll be there to soothe your mind\nJust call me up on the telephone\nWhen you're all alone\nAnd I'll give you a verbal massage\nUntil your man gets home\nOr if you want to you know what you could do, well\nYou could always hop in your car and you could come and ring my bell\n\nCome and ring my bell, ring my bell\n(my bell, ding-dong, ding-dong)\nCome and ring my bell, ring my bell\n(my bell, ring-a-ling-a-ling)\n\nGirl the way he treats you it's a crying shame\nLike you're a toy and like your life is just some silly game\nHow long you gonna live in a situation like this\nCause you're a princess baby and you deserve a prince\nWhy can't you see it, it's plain as day right here before your eyes\nI'm telling the truth while your man insists on telling you lies\nHe stays out all night but I'd be home by 8\nAnd oh and about loving, hmm it's grrrrrrreat\nI don't mean to insult your man up\nBut I'm trying to plan the\nRest of our lives together forever and ever\nBut first you got to stand up\nPick yourself up on your own two\nCause girl don't nobody own you\nYou don't feel well and I can tell\nBut I'll be here so ring my bell\n\nBREAK!\nYou can ring my bell, you can ring my bell\nDing dong ding, hey-hey, ring it\nYou can ring my bell, anytime, anyplace\nRing it (you)\nRing it (you)\nRing it, ring it Ahhh\n\nOpen up your mind and you can see that I'm\nJust trying to make you happy\nAnd like I said a 1000 times\nIf you didn't love me you wouldn't be calling me up every night\nTo wipe your tears 'cause you and your man just had another fight\nWho loves ya baby, I do\nYou know he doesn't care about you, let him go\nWhere's he at now, you don't know\nLaying up under some hooo-ld up, wait, just let me chill\nNo need for me to get ill\n'cause every time your heart gets knocked over\nYou know I'll wipe the spill\nI know this sounds like a fairy tale\nBut this ain't no children's book\nI'm here, for you to take me dear\nJust open your eyes and look\nAt what the future holds for you and\nIf you _ then you might ruin something great\nDon't make a big mistake\nPay attention to what you're doing\nLife is full of pitfalls, ups and down\nIt's sort of a mission\nNow you're on a rocky road\nBut you can get off\nJust make that decision\nThat you want someone to love you, adore you and hold you and treat you well\nSo when you're ready to be treated that way, baby you can ring my bell\n\n(Repeat till fade)",
