 "lyrics": "We like the breeze flow straight out of our lids\nThem they got moved by these hard-rock Brooklyn kids\nUs floor rush when the DJ's booming classics\nYou, dig the crew on the fattest hip-hop records\nHe touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds\nShe frequents the fattest joints caught underground\nOur funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane\nThey flock to booms man boogie had to change\nWho freaks the clips with mad amount percussion\nWhere kinky hair goes to unthought-of dimensions\nWhy's it so fly? 'Cause hip-hop kept some drama\nWhen Butterfly rocked his light blue-suede Pumas\nWhat by the cut we push it off the corner\nHow was the buzz entire hip hop era\nWas fresh and fat since they started saying outtie\n'Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie\nThe poobah of the styles like Miles and shit\nLike \nsixties funky worms\n with \nwaves and perms\nJust sendin' junky rhythms right down ya block\nWe be to rap what key be to lock\n\nBut \nI'm cool like dat\nI'm cool like dat\nI'm cool like dat\nI'm cool like dat\nI'm cool like dat\nI'm cool like dat\nI'm cool like dat\nI'm cool\n\nWe be the chocolates taps on my raps\nShe innovates at the sweeter cat naps\nHe at the funk club with the vibrate\nThem they be crazy down with the five Nat'\nIt can kick a plan then a crowd burst\nMe I be digging it with a bump verse\nUs we be freaking til dawn blinks an eye\nHe gives the strangest smile so I say hi (wassup)\nWho understood, yeah understood the plans\nHim heard a beat and put it to his hands\nWhat I just flip let borders get loose\nHow to consume or they'll be just like juice\nIf it's the shit we'll lift it off the plastic\nThe babes'll go spastic\n, \nhip-hop gains a classic\nPimp playing shock it don't matter I'm fatter\nAsk Butta how I zone (man, Cleopatra Jones)\n\nAnd I'm chill like dat\nI'm chill like dat\nI'm chill like dat\nI'm chill like dat\nI'm chill like dat\nI'm chill like dat\nI'm chill like dat\nI'm chill\n\nBlink..blink..blink..blink..blink..blink..blink....\nThink..think..think..think..think..think..think...\n\nWe getcha free 'cause the clips be fat boss\nThem, they're the jams and commence to going off\nShe sweats the beat and ask me 'cause she puffed it\nMe, I got crew kids \nseven and a crescent\nUs cause a buzz when the nickel bags are dealt\nHim, that's my man with the asteroid belt\nThey catch a fizz from the Mr. Doodle-big\nHe rocks a tee from the Crooklyn nine-pigs\nThe rebirth of slick like my gangsta stroll\nThe lyrics just like loot come in stacks and rolls\nYou used to find a Bug in a box with fade\nNow he boogies up your stage plaits twist or braids\n\nAnd I'm peace like dat\nI'm peace like dat\nI'm peace like dat\nI'm peace like dat\nI'm peace like dat\nI'm peace like dat\nI'm peace like dat\nI'm peace\n[Outro: Butterfly, \nLadybug\n, and \nDoodlebug\n]\nCheck it out man I groove like dat\nI'm smooth like dat\nI jive like dat\nI roll like dat\nYeah I'm thick like dat\nI stack like dat\nI'm down like dat\nI'm black like dat\nWell yo I funk like dat\nI'm phat like dat\nI'm in like dat\n'Cause I swing like dat\nWe jazz like dat\nWe freak like dat\nWe zoom like dat\nWe out, we out...",
