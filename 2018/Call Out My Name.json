(Why can't you wait, baby?)\nGirl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?\nWon't you call out my name? (Call out my name)\nGirl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and\nI'll be on my\u2014\n\nI said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied\nI almost cut a piece of myself for your life\nGuess I was just another pit stop\n'Til you made up your mind\nYou just wasted my time\n\nYou were on top, I put you on top\nI claimed you so proud and openly, babe\nAnd when times were rough, when times were rough\nI made sure I held you close to me\n\nSo call out \nmy\n name\n (Call out my name, baby)\nSo call out my name when I kiss you so gently (Ohh)\nI want you to stay (I want you to stay)\nI want you to stay even though you don't want me\nGirl, why can't you wait? (Girl, why can't you wait 'til I?)\nGirl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?\nBabe, call out my name (Say call out my name, baby)\nGirl call out my name and I'll be on my way\nAnd, I'll be on my\u2014\n\nOn my way, on my way\nOn my way, on my way, ooh\nOn my way, on my way, on my way\nOn my way, on my way, on my way\n(On my)",
