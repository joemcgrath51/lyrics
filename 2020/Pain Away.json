(They ain't lynchin' niggas)\nThe opposition be sayin' my name, tryna get attention with it (Get attention with it)\nI know an opp, he was suspect, now he a victim with it (Victim with it)\n\nI just hope this money take the pain away\nAnd I've been tryna save my money for a rainy day\nBut I just bought the Rolls truck to take the pain away\nAnd all these diamonds give me confidence\nDon't judge my pain if you don't know the shit that I'm against, ayy",
