I know that I will never disappoint myself\n(I must have cried a thousand times)\nIf you've cried a thousand times\nLadies, you will survive!\n(I can't regret time spent with you)\nYeah! You hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way\n(So I have vowed to make it through)\nI can see the sun shine\nI got me, myself, and I",
