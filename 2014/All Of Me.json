 "lyrics": "I give you my all, but it seems like that's not enough\nNow you can get all of me\nA lot of things have changed from what I see\nIs this the way its supossed to be\n\nAre you in that mood yet, one mo' 'gain\nARE YOU IN THAT MOOD YET\nLook, they say tomorrow's not promised, but if it was I wouldn't get open\nWouldn't get souped, them shit's was made to be broken\n'Member comin' up dudes talkin' 'bout hoes, boastin'\nI was just a Juvenile movin in slow motion\nI dropped outta school to be a dude with mad jewelry\nOnce I got it shit wasn't even cool to me\nI dreamt of condos and video vixens\nUntil I learned most girls in videos is pigeons\nI just wanted the world to see that I was for real with it\nWanted a deal, I got it and couldn't deal with it\nI want me and my old homeboys to still kick it\nI wish they saw me as Mouse and not a meal ticket\nLet the beat play, I wish I could see a day wit no he say, she say, just wanna see Trey\nWanna play the hood and not fuck with the toasters\nMiddle child, wish me and my brother was closer\nI wanna scream at her, catch myself before I start to\nAnd then remember it takes two people to argue\nAll she do is provoke me, all I do is diss her\nAll I did was shake her, she say that I hit her\nShe just takin' everythin' I say out of context\nI'm tryin' not to black, I'm like a nigga with a complex\nWas mad as a fuck, didn't even show it\nYesterday was better off, didn't even know it\nComplete role reversal so it's useless these days\nTV got real, music went fake, please help her for God's sake\nWhen I proposed to the game I figured life was merry\nFive years later I'm feelin' like Tyler Perry\nMaybe I'm exhausted, maybe I just lost it\nMaybe I should pick up a pen and try n' force it\nSame old story, guts and no glory\nThey tryna low ball me, do him like Joe Torre\nI reintroduced myself to the world: I'm Jerz\nI'm an artist, I paint pictures, I don't rhyme words\nMore than a rapper, I pay attention to detail\nBut how I do in retail tells me if I prevail\nLeonardo ain't seen these trials and tribulations\nFoul situations with some mild stipulations\nI feel like being an addict is a curse\nIt's somethin' 'bout dude that makes bad shit worse\nThere's three types of niggas in this world, you know?\nSo you either gon' make shit happen (or)\nWatch shit happen or (or,) not know what happened\nSo I couldn't just sit there like, fuck rappin'\nIt's dudes with problems I couldn't imagine havin'\nIf I had to have 'em I couldn't fathom me lastin', like\nI used to bump into Tammy in the club\nFew of them, she even helped a nigga get in\nSee a person long enough you know you bound to get fly wit 'em\nCare for 'em, be more than \"hi\" and \"bye\" with 'em\nIts been a while, I can't front like I ain't phased\nShe was my reality check, 'cause we the same age\nI mean she put on a show that you can't stage\nShe made the shit sound effortless\nI was damn near in tears checkin' my messages\nI got goosebumps all over my skin\nShe said, \"Mouse, I highly doubt that I'll ever see you again\"\nHope everything is well, kid\nYou see I'm just findin' out I have a brain tumor, but I never felt it\nThe doctor's giving me three weeks to live\nNot three weeks 'til I die, that's three weeks to give\nI just wanna tell you that I love you and I care\nI wish you all the best throughout the rest of your career\"\nAnd then she broke into tears\nI pressed seven, took the phone from my ears\nSometimes the simplest of things people need it\nBut I ain't call back in fear of being speechless\nWhat was I to put her at ease with\nI picked a real bad time to be strategic\nI think my life's bad, picking up the pieces\nSome folk already got they appointment to see Jesus\nIn this world full of diseases\nI've learned not to bite my tongue or have seizures\nDepression tells me I suck\nSo I reply, I ain't here 'cause I fell down, I'm here 'cause I got up\nAnd then I'm goin' back and forth with Ransom\nShit came outta nowhere, was real random\nAccording to him, I'm responsible for Jerz too\nI never helped niggas, how the fuck you think they heard you\nMotherfucka's got a lot of nerve, dude\nI was the nigga believed in you spittin'\nHad to con the industry just so they would listen\nBut go 'head, you just gon' rep yourself\nHow was you protecting me, you can't protect yourself\nKeep the lies to a minimal, just read your interview\nI can't help but ask what's gotten into dude\nMedia trainin' but he don't know how that go\nIt'd help you come across not soundin' like an asshole\nIn my past though been to jail, I ain't enjoy it\nSo why would I stand behind the mic and exploit it\nI ain't ig'nant, just because I exercise spiritually\nThey try to ignore how I exercise lyrically\nI thought I had a great job\nBack when niggas loved the culture, wasn't in it for the money like a A-Rod\nEven when I'm spitting 'bout current events\nIts a sublime sayin', who's more current than him?\nSo I'm wonderin', if a higher power tryna under-man\nWhen you shoot for the stars, sometimes your gun'll jam\nI ain't been to Summer Jam\nI learned from Lupe: when you dumb it down its just harder to understand\n2008, foes is still near me\nSo you can think I'm tight as FUCK, I'm still weary\nThe Geto Boys say its all in the mind\nCertain wounds only heal over time\nNo shame in my game, no pain, no gain\nAnd since I ain't see a prophet I figured God would stop it\nWaitin' on a alley, niggas just won't lob it\nStill a risk taker let me put it in words\nCan't steal second base and keep your foot on first\nBeen about ten years since I was high off the angel\nNow I'm walkin' side by side with an angel\nIn front of my eyes that prize keep gettin' dangled\nBut can't grab at it, my pride is being strangled\nWorkin' shorty's nerves like a personal trainer\nBut its me, its personal, it ain't her\nFriends keep tellin me leave her, I won't\nCause she sees somethin' in me that I don't\nAnd I see somethin' in her that ya'll won't\nIf you never been in love don't tell me I'm wrong\nSee I preach gratitude, she keeps an attitude\nArgue long enough and that shit becomes laughable\nMy norm now since for her it's so natural\nWish I could tell her that all them niggas after you\nSo not compatible, that we compatible\nIts nothin' else in this world that we would rather do\nAnybody out there relate to my pain\nTurn the music up let me know that I'm sane\nWe broke up, bitches was starin' at my chain\nDude was fuckin' you but starin' at my name\nBut we ain't gotta entertain all that\nBack like we never left, we overcame all that\nFuck who made better tacos or who's ass fatter\nLet's live for now, right now, none of that matters\nKeep bringin' it up its goin' backlash us\nWhy am I meeting so many back-stabbers?\nWhy when I'm about to crash I go faster? Past is a disaster\nWhen your house is see through, learn to close your eyes\nIn case the Glass shatters\nJust sayin', it's always a million more pages when my stupid ass keep\nThinkin' I'm on the last chapter\nNo tit for tat, I ain't equipped for that\nBack in New York, chit chat with a Midget Mack\nAs I get older...I keep gettin' sick of rap\nWanna call it quits, but a nigga can't picture that...",
