 "lyrics": "Sweet love, yeah\n\nI didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so\nI shoulda held on tight, I never shoulda let you go\nI didn't know nothing, I was stupid, I was foolish\nI was lying to myself\nI couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love\nNever imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself\nGuess I didn't know you, guess I didn't know me\nBut I thought I knew everything I never felt\n\nThe feeling that I'm feeling now that I don't hear your voice\nOr have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice\nOh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side\nRight here, 'cause, baby (We belong together)\n\nWhen you left, I lost a part of me (Together)\nIt's still so hard to believe\nCome back, baby, please\n(Come back, come back, come back, come back)\n'Cause we belong together\nWho else am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who else)\nWho's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who else)\nWho's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who else)\nOh, baby, baby, we belong together\n\nI can't sleep at night, when you are on my mind\nBobby Womack's on the radio\nSinging to me, \"If you think you're lonely now\"\nWait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)\nI gotta change the station\nSo I turn the dial, tryin' to catch a break\nAnd then I hear Babyface, \"I only think of you\"\nAnd it's breaking my heart\nI'm tryna keep it together, but I'm falling apart\n\nI'm feelin' all out of my element\nThrowin' things, cryin'\nTryin' to figure out where the hell I went wrong\nThe pain reflected in this song\nAin't even half of what I'm feeling inside\nI need you, need you back in my life, baby (My life, my life)\n(We belong together)\n\nWhen you left, I lost a part of me (Together)\nIt's still so hard to believe\nCome back, baby, please\n(Come back, come back, come back, come back)\n'Cause we belong together\nWho else am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)\nWho's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)\nWho's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?)\nOh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby\n(We belong together) (Who will?)\n\nWhen you left, I lost a part of me (Who will?)\nIt's still so hard to believe (Who will?)\nCome back, baby, please\n(Come back, come back, come back, come back)\n'Cause we belong together\nWho am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)\nWho's gonna talk to me 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)\nWho's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?)\nOh, baby, baby, we belong together\n\n(Who will? Who will? Who will?)\nWe belong together",
