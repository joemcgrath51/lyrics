 "lyrics": "I thought I knew\nI didn't know I could tell you\nI coulda told you\nI adore you, I adore you\nI shoulda told you\n\nYou said farewell, but\nI didn't know I could hold you\nI coulda warned you\nI adore you, I adore you\nI wish I told you\n\nBack in the summer\nWhile in the water\nYou touched my hair\nYou said you liked it\nI know you liked it, I know it well\nI know you well\n\nAnd in the cool bar\nWhile we were dancing, you grabbed my waist\nI know you liked it\nYou said you liked it\nI know it well\nI know you well\n\nHere we go\nHere it is, ah-ah-ah\nTake a good hard look at it, ah-ah-ah\nOh, to be a part of it, ah-ah-ah\nOne day, you will see, my love\nYou belong to me\n\nI adore you, I adore you\nOh, ah",
