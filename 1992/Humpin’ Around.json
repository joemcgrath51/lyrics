 "lyrics": "When you trust someone\nAnd you know you're on their back\nYou ain't got no trusting about you\nAnd you claim that you\nDon't care what where I'm at\nYou've given me reason to doubt you\nSay you trust someone\nWhy are you calling all around\nThink I've got some dip on the side\nGirl you don't trust no one\nAnd you're constantly in doubt\nYou lose the game, if you play that way\n\nGet up off my back\nSave a heart attack\nAin't nobody \nHumpin' Around\n (Ain't nobody humpin around)\nNo matter what they say\nNo it ain't that way\nAin't nobody humpin around\nNobody \nHumpin' around babe\nWhen you love someone\nAnd you want to love them right\nGot to get more lovin' about you\nAnd you know that you're holding on too tight\nSoon they will be leaving without you\nSay that you love someone\nWhy are you calling all my friends\nThinking I've got something to hide\nGirl you don't love no one\nYou don't know what love's about\nYou lose the game, (if you) if you play that way\n\nGirl when you trust someone\nYou don't call on everybody\nAin't nobody foolin' around\nAnd the more I think about it\nYou lose all your clout\nYou lose the game, baby, if you play that way\n\nMy name is Brown\nThat's what I'm called\nSo don't try to step to be wrong\nOr you'll fall slow\n'Cos I just wanna get something to you\nMaybe take control of you just like\nI told you (I wanna roll)\nOn a tip that's movin\nIm gonna make ya movin, grovin\nLeavin ya like Ooo\nWhen I touch ya\nGive ya so much\nThe feeling of the effect that I'm dealin\nWhen I rub ya up & down\n\nGirl you said you love me\nAnd you said you trust me\nWhy do you think I'm foolin' around\nI can't stand the pressure\nYou know I'm yours forever\nAin't nobody, nobody, nobody humpin' around\n x2",
