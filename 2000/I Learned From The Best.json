 "lyrics": "Did you really think that\nI would really take you back\nLet you back in my heart one more time, oh, no, no\nDid you think that I'd still care\nThat there'd be more feeling there\nDid you think you could walk back in my life\nSo you found you miss the love you threw away\nBaby but you found it out too late, too Late\n\nAnd so you know the way it feels to cry\nThe way that I cried when you broke my world in two\nBaby, I learned the way to break a heart\nI learned from the best\nI learned from you (Oh baby now)\nI learned from you\n\nI remember cold nights\nTears I thought would never dry\nHow you shattered my world\nWith your goodbye, your goodbye baby\nWould've sold my soul then\nJust to have you back again\nNow you're the last thing on my mind\nNow you say you're sorry and\nYou've changed your ways\nSorry but you changed your ways too late\n\nAnd so you know the way it feels to cry\nThe way that I cried when you broke my world in two\nBaby, I learned the way to break a heart\nI learned from the best\nI learned from you (Oh baby now)\nI learned from you\n\nSo when all you've got are sleepless nights\nWhen those tears are clouding up your eyes\nJust remember it was you who said goodbye\nWho said goodbye\n\n\nAnd so you know the way it feels to cry\nThe way that I cried when you broke my world in two\nBaby, I learned the way to break a heart\nI learned from the best\nI learned from you\nLearned the way to break a heart\nI learned from the best\nI learned from you\nI learned from the best\nI learned from you",
