Destiny\nOh, let's make it tonight\n\nLet's make tonight the night (let's make up)\nLet's make tonight the night (in the beginning)\nLet's make tonight the night (all the deeper love yeah)\nLet's make tonight the night (to every little thing i wanted baby baby)\nTonight's the night, tonight's the night\nYou're everything I want (everything I want)\nTonight's the night, tonight's the night\nCan't you see it?
