 "lyrics": "Listen, dear\nI realise that you've been hurt, deep\nBecause I've been there\nBut regardless to who, what, why, when and where\nWe're all precious in his sight\nAnd a rose is still, and always will be, a rose\nDoo doo doo doo doo doo mmm\nDooby dooby doo doo doo doo\nDoo doo doo doo doo doo mmm\n\nThere was a rose I knew, I done met her once or twice before\nShe was a pretty sweet thing, not the least bit insecure\nThen you came with your slick game and played with her youth\nUnashamed of the way you lied and played with the truth, hey hey\nShe never knew what hit her, oh\nSteal her honey, then forget her\nNow the rose is scorned\nShe wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you\n\n'Cause a rose is still a rose\nBaby girl, you're still a flower\nHe can't leave you and then take you\nMake you and then break you\nDarlin', you hold the power (what I am is what I am)\n\nNow believe me when I tell you that I've been hurt myself\nWhen he tells you that he loves you, it's you, nobody else\nAnd now you're so tough, tryin' to wear tight clothes and things\nTossin' and flossin', tryin' to fill the void heartbreak brings\nOh, oh, yeah\nWhen she gets nearer\nShe's cryin', you can't hear her\nNow the rose is scorned\nShe wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you\n\n'Cause a rose is still a rose\nBaby girl, you're still a flower\nHe can't leave you and then take you\nMake you and then break you\nBaby girl, you hold the power (what I am is what I am)\n\nSee, a rose is still a rose\nBaby girl, you're still a flower\nHe can't leave you and then take you\nMake you and then break you\nDarlin', you hold the power (what I am is what I am)\n\nLet your life be in the sunshine\nNot the darkness of your sorrow\nYou may see you're lost today\nBut new love will come tomorrow\nDon't believe that life is over\nJust because your man is gone\nGirl, love yourself enough to know\nThat without him, your life goes on\nWithout him, your life goes on\nAnd without him, your life goes on\n\n'Cause a rose is still a rose\nBaby girl, you're still a flower\nHe can't leave you and then take you\nMake you and then break you\nBaby girl, you hold the power (what I am is what I am)\n\nSee, a rose is still a rose\nBaby girl, you're still a flower\nHe can't leave you and then take you\nMake you and then break you\nDarlin', you hold the power (what I am is what I am)",
