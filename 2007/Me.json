 "lyrics": "Love was the former owner\nBut quiet is renting our house\nIt ceases my lips from speaking\nBut forms a sarcastic smile\nSuspense now raised one of your eyebrows\nYou asked me if there's someone else\nI replied yes hell yes\n\nYou asked if it's another man I said NO\nYou laughed and say is it a woman I say YES\nSurprisingly you ask me for honey's name\n\nAnd her name is me\nAnd she loves me more than you'll ever know\nAnd I finally see that\nLoving you and loving me just don't seem to work at all\nSo patiently\nShe's waiting on me to tell you that she needs love\nAnd to choose between you two\nBoy you know if I have to choose I choose me\n\nAnd she told me to tell you to never to hurt me again\nCause if you haven't heard she's a bad chick\nEven though I haven't been no\nYet and still you try and test me by raising an angry hand\nPut it down put it down\n\nI'm leaving don't try and stop me NO\nI'm late and she is waiting YES\nMy love for me is too much so I can't stay\n\nAnd her name is me\nAnd she loves me more than you'll ever know\nAnd I finally see that\nLoving you and loving me just don't seem to work at all\nSo patiently\nShe's waiting on me to tell you that she needs love\nAnd to choose between you two\nBoy you know if I have to choose I choose me\n\nCause she's actually forming a threesome\nAnd I'm happy that I can join them\nTheir names are me myself and I\n\nAnd her name is me\nShe loves me more than you'll ever know\nI finally see that\nLoving you and loving me just don't seem to work at all\nSo patiently\nShe's waiting on me to tell you that she needs love\nAnd to choose between you two\nBoy you know if I have to choose I choose me\nShe's waiting on me to tell you that she needs love\nGotta to choose between you two\nAnd you know if I have to choose I choose me\nI gotta go with me",
