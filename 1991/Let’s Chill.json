(Reality)\nIf it's a fantasy, please don't wake me\n\nAll my love is for you\nWhatever you want, I will do\nYou're the only one I want in my life\nFor you, I'll make that sacrifice, so, baby, let's\n\n(Let's chill) Let's chill\n(And let's settle down) Settle down, baby\n(That's what I wanna do) That's what I want to do\n(Just me and you) Oh\n(Let's chill) Let's chill, baby\n(And let's settle down) Oh-oh, oh-oh\n(That's what I wanna do) I want to do\n(Just me and you)\n\nCome here, baby\nCome lay next to me\nLet's forget about the past and think about the future\nLet's get together baby\nLet's stay together\nOh, oh\nLet's chill, baby\n\n(Let's chill)\n(And let's settle down) Settle down\n(That's what I wanna do) All in my mind\n(Just me and you) To do with you, baby\n(Let's chill) So, let's chill\n(And let's settle down) Come on, baby\n(That's what I wanna do) That's all I want to do with you\n(Just me and you)\n\nForever and ever\nEver and ever\nEver and ever, always\nForever and ever\nEver and ever\nEver and ever, always",
