(Tell me, would you?)\nWell, baby, I've been around the world\nBut I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)\nThis ring here represents my heart\nBut there's just one thing I need from you (Saying \"I do\")\nBecause\n\nI can see us holdin' hands\nWalkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand\nI can see us on the country side\nSittin' on the grass, layin' side by side\nYou can be my baby\nLet me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me\nAin't gotta do nothin' crazy\nSee, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)\nMy love (So don't give away)\nMy love (So don't give away)\nAin't another woman that could take your spot\nMy love (So don't give away)\nMy love (So don't give away)\nMy love (So don't give away)\nAin't another woman that could take your spot, my love\nLove, girl, my love, my love\n\nNow If I wrote you a love note\nAnd made you smile at every word I wrote (What would you do?)\nWould that make you wanna change your scene\nAnd wanna be the one on my team? (Tell me, would you?)\nSee, what's the point in waitin' anymore?\n'Cause girl, I've never been more sure (That, baby, it's you)\nThis ring here represents my heart\nAnd everything that you been waitin' for (Just say it, \"I do\")\nBecause\n\nI can see us holdin' hands\nWalkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand\nI can see us on the country side\nSittin' on the grass, layin' side by side\nYou can be my baby\nLet me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me\nAin't gotta do nothin' crazy\nSee, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)\nMy love (So don't give away)\nMy love (So don't give away)\nAin't another woman that could take your spot\nMy love (So don't give away)\nMy love (So don't give away)\nMy love (So don't give away)\nAin't another woman that could take your spot, my love\nLove, my love, my love\n\nAight, it's time to get it, JT\nI don't know what you hesitatin' for, man\nAy, ay, ay\n\nShawty cool as a fan, on the move once again (Ay)\nBut he still has fans from Peru to Japan\nHey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (Nah)\nBut if you got a man, try to lose him if you can\n'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high\nWhen they wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy\nYou don't really wanna let the chance go by\n'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly\nAnd, babe, with friends so fly, I can go fly\nPrivate, 'cause I handle my B.I\nThey call me Candle Guy (Why?)\nSimply 'cause I am on fire (Haha)\nI hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny\nI'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (Nah)\nYou don't come, I ain't gon' die\nHold up, what you mean? You can't go? Why? (Why?)\nMe and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (Uh-uh)\nYou say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (Man...)\nWell, baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy\nI ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space\nBut forget your face, I swear I will\nSt. Bart's, Anguilla, anywhere I chill (Nice)\nJust bring with me a pair, I will (C'mon)\n\nI can see us holdin' hands\nWalkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand\nI can see us on the country side\nSittin' on the grass, layin' side by side\nYou can be my baby\nLet me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me\nAin't gotta do nothin' crazy\nSee, all I want you to do is be my love (Love)\nMy love (Love)\nMy love (Love)\nAin't another woman that could take your spot\nMy love (Love)\nMy love (Love)\nMy love (Love)\nAin't another woman that could take your spot, my love\nLove, love, my love, my love",
