(Oh, yeah, yeah)\nThe one I used to laugh and joke with?\nThe one I used to tell all my secrets?\nWe used to chill and be down for whatever, whenever together, yeah\n\nAnd my mind's gone half crazy (Oh) 'cause I can't leave you alone (I'm going half crazy, baby)\nAnd I'm wonderin' if it's worth me (Oh) holdin' on (Over you, yeah)\nSaid my mind's gone half crazy (Yeah) 'cause I can't leave you alone (And I just don't know)\nAnd I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (I said I just don't know what to do now)\n(Listen, we used to chill)\nAnd my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Yeah, we used to hang)\nAnd I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Yeah, we used to do, we used to do some many things together, yeah)\nSaid my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nAnd I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Oh oh, yeah)\nOh, oh, oh, uh",
