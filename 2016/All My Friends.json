Sure, I get lonely sometimes\n\nAll my friends are wasted\nAnd I hate this club\nMan, I drink too much\nAnother Friday night I've wasted\nMy eyes are black and red\nI'm crawling back to your bed\n\nI hate the bar (IGH!)\nPharmacy addict, hear the Wall Street traffic\nTook the car (IGH!)\nWe reinvent the wheel just to fall asleep at it\u2014skrrrt!\nCrash on the floor, catch the z-z-z's (Hunh)\nPopping the polar opposite of NZT (Hunh)\nHip-hop and the propaganda say they name-brand (Name-brand)\nBut I done seen how the \n*censored*\n did my main man (Main man)\nThe nights we won't remember are the nights we won't remember (IGH!)\nI'll be gone 'til November, all my city call for Simba (IGH!)\nDreams are made for cages, nigga, lions are for real\nNigga, dying is for real, niggas dying off of pills (Woo!)\nNigga, fridays are for chill and I escaped the treachery\nI just had to rest-in-peace the recipe\nThe rest of us are prayin' that the sand will leave a tan\nIf you're up right now, hope you hear what I'm saying\nHope you hear what I'm saying\n\nAll my friends are wasted\nAnd I hate this club\nMan, I drink too much\nAnother Friday night I've wasted\nMy eyes are black and red (Woo!)\nI'm crawling back to your bed\n\nDo you get lonely? Sure, I get lonely, some nights\nWhen the angels on my shoulder slumber and I'm stuck here\nWith the vultures, hissing and circling\nYou didn't call me (Call me, call me, call me)\n[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe & \nChance the Rapper\n]\nOoh, I'm crawling, crawling\nCrawling back to you (\nIGH!\n)\n[Chorus: Tinashe & Snakehips, \nChance the Rapper\n, & \nAll\n]\nAll my friends are wasted (\nAll my friends are wasted\n)\nAnd I hate this club\nMan, I drink too much (\nToo much, I drink too much\n)\nAnother Friday night I've wasted\nMy eyes are black and red\nI'm crawling back to your bed\nAll my friends are wasted\n (\nAll my friends are wasted\n)\nAnd I hate this club\nMan, I drink too much\nAnother Friday night I've wasted\nMy eyes are black and red\nI'm crawling back to your bed",
