 "lyrics": "Drums Please!\n\nSummer, summer, summertime\nTime to sit back and unwind\n\nHere it is the groove slightly transformed\nJust a bit of a break from the norm\nJust a little somethin' to break the monotony\nOf all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be\nA little bit out of control it's cool to dance\nBut what about the groove that soothes that moves romance\nGive me a soft subtle mix\nAnd if ain't broke then don't try to fix it\nAnd think of the summers of the past\nAdjust the bass and let the Alpine blast\nPop in my CD and let me run a rhyme\nAnd put your car on cruise and lay back 'cause this is summertime\n\nSummer, summer, summertime\nTime to sit back and unwind\n\nSchool is out and it's a sort of a buzz\nBut back then I didn't really know what it was\nBut now I see what have of this\nThe way that people respond to \nsummer madness\nThe weather is hot and girls are dressin' less\nAnd checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best\nRiding around in your Jeep or your Benzos\nOr in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos\nBack in Philly we be out in the park\nA place called the Plateau is where everybody goes\nGuys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise\nHonkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes\nShe turn around to see what you beepin' at\nIt's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac\nAnd with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme\nTo hip you and to get you equipped for the summertime\n\nSummer, summer, summertime\nTime to sit back and unwind\n\nIt's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet\nHustle to the mall to get me a short set\nYeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair\nCause basketball courts in the summer got girls there\nThe temperature's about 88\nHop in the water plug just for old times sake\nBreak to ya crib change your clothes once more\nCause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4\nSittin' with your friends cause y'all reminisce\nAbout the days growin' up and the first person you kiss\nAnd as I think back makes me wonder how\nThe smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia\nAll the kids playin' out front\nLittle boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch\nWhile the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion\nThen six o'clock rolls around\nYou just finished wipin' your car down\nIt's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout\nIt looks like a car show\nEverybody come lookin' real fine\nFresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon\nEvery moment frontin' and maxin'\nChillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'\nLeanin' to the side but you can't speed through\nTwo miles an hour so everybody sees you\nThere's an air of love and of happiness\nAnd this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness\n\nSummer, summer, summertime\nTime to sit back and unwind",
