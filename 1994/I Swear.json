 "lyrics": "I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky\nAnd I swear like the shadow that's by your side\n\nI see the questions in your eyes\nI know what's weighing on your mind\nYou can be sure I know my part\n'Cause I stand beside you through the years\nYou'll only cry those happy tears\nAnd though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart\n\nAnd I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky\nI'll be there\nI swear like the shadow that's by your side\nI'll be there\nFor better or worse, 'til death do us part\nI'll love you with every beat of my heart\nAnd I swear\n\nI'll give you everything I can\nI'll build your dreams with these two hands\nWe'll hang some memories on the walls\nAnd when (and when) just the two of us are there\nYou won't have to ask if I still care\n'Cause as the time turns the page\nMy love won't age at all\n\nAnd I swear (I swear) by the moon\nAnd the stars in the sky I'll be there (I'll be there)\nI swear (and I swear) like the shadow that's by your side\nI'll be there (I'll be there)\nFor better or worse, 'til death do us part\nI'll love you with every beat of my heart\nAnd I swear\n\nI swear (I swear) by the moon and the stars in the sky\nI'll be there (I'll be there)\nI swear like the shadow that's by your side\nI'll be there (I'll be there)\nFor better or worse (better or worse)\nTill death do us part (oh no) I'll love you\nWith every single beat of my heart\n\nI swear\nI swear\nOh, I swear",
