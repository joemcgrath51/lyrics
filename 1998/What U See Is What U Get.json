 "lyrics": "And so it was written, and after all these things\nI saw another angel come down from heaven\nHaving great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory\nAnd he cried mightily with a strong voice saying\n\"Babylon the great has fallen\nHas fallen and has become the habitation of devils\nAnd the home to every foul spirit\nAnd a cage of very unclean, and hateful men\"\n\nYeah, what you see is what you get now\nXzibit never wait around for no kickdown, \ngot my own shit loud\nShot heard around the world\nUplift, bench press, arm curl, keep the structure of the temple\nTo make things simple, my existence is a ripple through time\nOnly concerned with what is mine, divine\nNever monkeyshine, walkin down a very thin line\nHoldin heat, runnin crazy in the streets, yeah (What's up?)\nPlus the company I keep put in overtime while you oversleep\nDon't wanna see none of this evil I speak\nAround the atlas, cum laude magna, the super actress\nYou all get clothe-lined and pinned to the mattress\nAll day, every day, every which way\nWho said you can't have your cake and eat it too (Fuck you!)\nThis is hard time on Planet Earth, for what it's worth\nXzibit stay in rotation without rehabilitation like this\n\nPlayers, pimps, hoes, hustlers\nWillies, thugs, ballers, busters\nGangstas, macks, everyday, all day\nShot callers, even high rollers keep it moving\n\nWhat you see is what you get now\nThe kinda style make the whole world go wild\nBless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone\nAnd no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit\n\nYou got more than you bargained for; hit the floor\nI pull a fast one to let you know today could be your last one black\nTake your breath like an asthma attack\nJust a slave \nlike Flavor Flav, \"You're blind to the facts\"\nMr. X to the Z, tha Liks and King Tee\nGuaranteed to bring the house down naturally\nNiggas knowin No Limits like Master P\nMakin you motherfuckin bastards see (What?)\nA whole different breed of MC; realize it's you against me\nCatch a three-hundred and sixty degree\nRoundhouse to the mouth right\nAnd like the sun, make the hot shit shine bright\nI feelin like my whole life is a green light never turn red\nCause I strike like a rattlesnake, lock like a dread\nNiggas wanna bump heads, but they better off dead\nCame crashin through the door like the Feds\n, bring it\n\nWhat you see is what you get now\nThe kinda style make the whole world go wild\nBless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone\nAnd no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit\n\nThe year everybody start to rush\nSwingin through is your friendly neighborhood lush\nI crack your bottle then watch how Xzibit bust\nI regulate like a killer with a nickel plate, I set it straight\nStart to shakin you down, breakin new ground, construction work\nHeavy artillery, put your dick in the dirt\nStay alert, the game is rough so you might get hurt\nSlug burnt through your jacket through your sweater, through your shirt\nGet cut from the belly up (What?)\nI break the chain, fast lane, suck my sugar cane\nI'm tryin to spark a nigga brain while you entertain trivial things\nMaterial things, protected by the underground kings\nWho rule the land with an iron fist\nThe Men in Black, if we flash can't remember shit (Sorry)\nYou cross me, I'll make you pay like the government, I wanna kill Sam\nCause my package came short twelve grams, get the picture?\n\nPlayers, pimps, hoes, hustlers\nWillies, thugs, ballers, busters\nGangstas, macks, everyday, all day\nShot callers, even high rollers keep it moving\n\nWhat you see is what you get now\nThe kinda style make the whole world go wild\nBless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone\nAnd no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit",
