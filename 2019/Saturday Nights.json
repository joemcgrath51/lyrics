 "lyrics": "Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos\nSwishers make my throat hurt\nRolling OCB's on the side for me\nLight 'em up and let 'em both burn\nFamily feuds, say your mom's confused\nOff of shit she doesn't wanna learn\nBut daddy's gone, say he's never home\nAnd wishing only makes it worse\n\nI guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep\n'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see\n\nAll the things that I know\nThat your parents don't\nThey don't care like I do\nNowhere like I do\nAnd all the things that I know\nThat your parents don't\nThey don't care like I do\nNowhere like I do\nNowhere like I do\nNowhere like I do\n\nSaturday nights, light gray Silverado\nYou drive it 'cause you have to\nStay up working late at a job you hate\nFix your makeup in a dirty bathroom\nNo more love, in and out of clubs\nKnowing what you gotta do\nYou've got plans wrapped in rubber bands\nAnd that's the only thing you'll never lose\n\nI guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep\n'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see\n\nAll the things that I know\nThat your parents don't\nThey don't care like I do\nNowhere like I do\nAnd all the things that I know\nThat your parents don't\nThey don't care like I do\nNowhere like I do\nNowhere like I do\n\n'Cause I care, I care about you\nThere's nowhere I'd rather be\nThan right here around you\nI care, care about you\nThere's nowhere I'd rather be\n\nAll the things that I know\nThat your parents don't\nThey don't care about you\nNowhere like I do\nAll the things that I know\nThat your parents don't\nDon't care about you\nNowhere like I\nNowhere like I do (Do, do, do)\nNowhere like I do (Do, do, do)\nNowhere like I do (Do, do, do)\nNowhere like I do (Do, do, do)",
