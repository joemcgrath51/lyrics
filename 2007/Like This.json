Kelly's back\n\nI told ya'll I was gonna bump like this\nYa'll didn't think that I could bump like this\nSaid I told ya'll I was gonna bump like this\nTurn around, then I make it jump like this\n(Ladies!) You wanna keep that boy, then make it jump like this\nYa'll didn't think that I could make it bump like this\nSee I told ya'll, ya'll was gonna jump like this\nHow you not gon' know it when it hit like this\n\nLadies, drama, leave it home\nIf he ain't got it right by now then scratch him off\nThey just called me, said it's about 20 strong\nThey standin' at the door, they wanna take us on\nThe ring - Let it go 'bout three months ago\nThe pain ain't stressin' me no more\nThe girl that they used to know done changed\nNow they sayin' this before they mention my name\n\nI told ya'll I was gonna bump like this\nYa'll didn't think that I could bump like this\nSaid I told ya'll I was gonna bump like this\nTurn around, then I make it jump like this\n(Ladies!) You wanna keep that boy, then make it jump like this\nYa'll didn't think that I could make it bump like this\nSee I told ya'll, ya'll was gonna jump like this\nHow you not gon' know it when it hit like this\n\nSee satellite, 664 came up real slow\nPut a good game on me\nTold him \"Partner don't get too close or come too bold\"\nCause the quick ain't for me\nGot my girls all here, near me\nSo spare me please all your personal info\nI ain't thinkin' 'bout love\nI just wanna get it up\nPop a bottle, talk a lot of bullshit\nAnd let's, let's go\n\nI told ya'll I was gonna bump like this\nYa'll didn't think that I could bump like this\nSaid I told ya'll I was gonna bump like this\nTurn around, then I make it jump like this\n(Ladies!) You wanna keep that boy, then make it jump like this\nYa'll didn't think that I could make it bump like this\nSee I told ya'll, ya'll was gonna jump like this\nHow you not gon' know it when it hit like this\n\nTonight I ain't feelin' no stress\nTo my girls that's lookin' their best\nWon't you go on and show it off for us\n(Ladies go on and throw your hands up)\nAnd...if he's all in your head\nJust forget all the things that he said\nGirl this is yours, do whatever you want to\n(Ladies go on and throw your hands up)\n\nHear these words out my mouth now\nTell you how it's goin' down\nKelly, E-V-E, we comin' through and got 'em bowin' down\nLadies can you feel it? It's an anthem, you can bounce around\nGive you just a second to take your breath, bring it back now\nDudes get excited seein' what they like\nHopin' you the one you choose, hope they get invited\nLate night rendezvous is all right\nBut we lovin' how the club vibratin', it's enticing\nLet the beat knock, trust me, we ain't gon' stop\nHead 'til the lights up, watch us take over the spot\nFew mad looks from them chicks you know\nAnd from them dudes who be jealous of a chick wit' dough\nPop another bottle for them, keep my life movin'\nNo time for the drama, watch me blow through them\nI know I sound confident, I'm supposed to though\nWe do it big, how we live, Kelly told you so, come on\n\nI told ya'll I was gonna bump like this\nYa'll didn't think that I could bump like this\nSaid I told ya'll I was gonna bump like this\nTurn around, then I make it jump like this\n(Ladies!) You wanna keep that boy, then make it jump like this\nYa'll didn't think that I could make it bump like this\nSee I told ya'll, ya'll was gonna jump like this\nHow you not gon' know it when it hit like this",
