 "lyrics": "Love, what have you done, oh wow\nI was sure up 'til now\nThat she was a friend\nI stayed 'til the end\n(Don't be a fool again)\nI once believed that love was fair\nBut I don't anymore\nShe said I'm a bore\nMy heart hit the floor\n(Don't be a fool anymore)\n\nEach time around I tell myself\n\"It's the game of love\"\nIgnore the signs and risk it all in the name of love\nWell, I've decided I can't let nobody hurt me again\nSo I'll say it 'til the end\n\nI just don't wanna be a fool (Don't wanna be a fool)\nSaid I don't wanna be a fool ever again\n\nWhenever a fool's in love\nHe doesn't know he's to blame\nHe's caught in the game\nIt all ends up the same\n(He doesn't feel the shame)\nHe looks at love in a different way\nIt breaks his heart every time\nThey all turn estranged\nBut he'll never change\n(He's never gonna change)\n\nOh, next time around I'll tell myself\n\"It'll be better than before\"\nI won't look back, there'll be no one\nTearing my heart out anymore, my baby\nI've just decided I can't let nobody fool me again\nSo I'll swear 'til the end\n\nI just don't wanna be a fool (Don't wanna be a fool)\nSaid I don't wanna be a fool ever again\n\n(No way) I mean no more\n(Never again) Ooh, no never\n(I can't be a fool) Can't be, no way\nNo way, no way\nOoh, I don't want to be\nI don't want to be a fool, no\n(I can't love anybody walking on a one way street)\nAny way, any way, any way, no\n(If I don't find somebody, that'll be alright with me)\nI know, I know it'll be alright now\n'Cause I decided not to let nobody kill me again\nSo I'll say it 'til the end\n\nI just don't wanna be a fool (Don't wanna be a fool)\nSaid I don't wanna be a fool never, never again\n\n(Don't wanna be a fool) Can't be a fool\n(Don't wanna be a fool) Ever again\n(I don't wanna be a fool) Never, oh never, oh never again\n(Don't wanna be a fool) Can't be a fool",
