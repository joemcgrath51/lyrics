Uh\nDon't worry about my niggas, ZooWap got 'em, uh\n\nOn everything, for 17 I'm wildin', ayy\nTreat my whole squad on an island, ayy\nZiploc gang, bring a lighter, ayy\nIt's gon' be a house party on this island, ayy\nShit boom like M80s on this island\nIt's a lot of trillionaires throwin' dollars\nCausin' pure hell, wildin' out on this island\nI do this too swell, my pockets too swell\nCome try the Hunned Gang, man they'll shoot ya\nI do this for my squad, I do this for my gang\nI do this for my squad, I do this for my gang\nIt's Zoovie from the trap and ain't a damn thing change\n\nMy niggas stack their money just to spend it\n'Cause when you die, you cannot take it with you\nIf you ain't beefin' 'bout the money, then what's the problem?\nDon't worry about my niggas 'cause I got 'em, uh\nMy niggas stack their money just to spend it, uh\n'Cause when you die you cannot take it with you\nAnd if you ain't beefin' 'bout no money, then what's the problem? Uh\nDon't worry about my niggas, ZooWap got 'em, uh",
