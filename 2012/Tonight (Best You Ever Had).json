Let me fix that\nTwist that\n\nBaby, tonight's the night I let you know\nBaby, tonight's the night we lose control\nBaby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that\nTonight I'll be the best you ever had\nI don't wanna brag, but I'll be\nThe best you ever had\nI don't wanna brag, but I'll be\nThe best you ever had\n\nI hit you with the best stroke\nFreestyle and then the breaststroke\nTil you blowing cigarette smoke\nAnd now the bed's broke\nSo what we gonna do now?\nFuck it, round two now\nWork it out, then we cool down\nCool down\n\nBaby, tonight's the night I let you know\nBaby, tonight's the night we lose control\nBaby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that\nTonight I'll be the best you ever had\nI don't wanna brag, but I'll be\nThe best you ever had\nI don't wanna brag, but I'll be\n(Give me a little bit of that light-skinned love, baby)\nThe best you ever had\n\nLuda! Listen\nYou ain't even gotta text me\nKnowing me and you got that mental telepathy\nMe be up at the spot, I'll be sending over the chauffeur\nRich nigga, bread stay popping like a toaster\nNobody come close to me and you together\nStep under my umbrella\nWe\u2019ll make it through any weather\nExcept when I make it storm\nSex in the greatest form\nAnd hibernate under my body\nYep, I keep it warmer than a chinchilla\nShe know I beat it up like the Thrilla in Manila\nFlying my private jet to villas in Anguilla\nThen throw you on a grill\nCause seven days a week you\u2019re my five course meal\n(For real)\n\nBaby, tonight's the night I let you know\nBaby, tonight's the night we lose control\nBaby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that\nTonight I'll be the best you ever had\nI don't wanna brag, but I'll be\nThe best you ever had\nI don't wanna brag, but I'll be\nThe best you ever had\nI don't wanna brag, but I'll be\nThe best you ever had",
