Nobody remember\nIt ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent\nIt happen to one of your people, it's different\nWe get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it\nKnowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted\nI won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me\nAin't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention\nIt's people who can, well, here's the chance\nI won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe\nMust not be breathing the air that I breathe\nYou know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed\nI never been a fan of police\nBut my neighborhood know I try to keep peace\nSo it's only right that I get in the streets\nMarch for a reason, not just on GP\nOur people died for us to be free\nFuck do you mean? This was a dream\nNow we got the power that we need to have\nThey don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah\n\nIt's bigger than black and white\nIt's a problem with the whole way of life\nIt can't change overnight\nBut we gotta start somewhere\nMight as well gon' 'head start here\nWe done had a hell of a year\nI'ma make it count while I'm here\nGod is the only man I fear\nIt's bigger than black and white\nIt's a problem with the whole way of life\nIt can't change overnight\nBut we gotta start somewhere\nMight as well gon' 'head start here\nWe done had a hell of a year\nI'ma make it count while I'm here\nGod is the only man I fear",
