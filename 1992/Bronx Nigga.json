Pull over...\nYeah, I'mma show this nigga what time it is\nYeah, let me get out...\nAyyo Boo, ayyo Boo, come here man, come here\n(Boo) Yeah, what's up? What's up?\nAyyo, check this out here...\n(Pop-pop-pop)\nTo hell with you! I'm a Bronx nigga\n\nI'm a Bronx nigga, I'm a Bronx nigga (x3)\n\nStandin' on the Ave., One-Six-Nine\nBitches lookin' dope and I'm going for mine\nThere's a girl named Lisa lookin' kind of fly\nShe walked by and cold winked her eye\nAwww shit, the bitch is on my dick\nThat's the piece of ass that I've got to hit\nSo I make my move, start to kick game\nShe had the nerve to ask me my name\n\"I'm the Dog, the largest motherfucker in my block\n\"Get in my car and let's hit the spot\n\"What's the spot? The spot that's my cribbo\n\"My place, my pad, bitch you know\n\"It's the place where I put my head to rest\n\"Just get in my ride and I'll tell you the rest\"\nWe was out and I was doin' 95\nGot to the crib in ten minutes time\nPoured her a nice cold drink\nWhispered in her ear and said \"I know what you think\"\nShe said \"What?\nI said \"I think you're all that\"\n\"How can you tell?\"\n\"Because your ass is phat\"\nShe said \"What? I know you're not tryin' to diss\"\n\"Naw, I'm just playin'. Yo, give me a kiss\"\nI was tonging the bitch down and finger-poppin'\nNext thing you know, her panties start droppin'\nI was dickin' her, dickin' her, dickin' her well\nDickin' her, dickin' her, dickin' her well\nDickin' her, dickin' her, dickin' her well...\nUntil the bitch started to yell\nI got up, washed my dick and got dressed\nShe said \"Dog you know you fuck the best\"\nI said \"Put on your shit, let's break out\n\"This ain't no motherfuckin' stake-out\"\nWe was out, dropped the bitch at the train\nThrew her a token, said \"Forget my name\"\nShe got upset and called me a \"bum nigga\"\nI said, \"No baby, huh, I'm a Bronx nigga\"\n\nI'm a Bronx nigga, I'm a Bronx nigga (x3)\n\nI'm a Black man tryin' to make an honest buck\nBut Five-O don't give a fuck\nPullin' me over at every single light\nHawking me every night\nBut there's this one night when the Five-O rolled up\nPulled me over and said \"Enough is enough\"\n(POLICE OFFICER) \"Hey, let me see your driver's license and your registration right now, BOY!\"\nYo, why it gotta be all that? What did I do?\nI didn't do nothin', man. Why you fuckin' with me?\n(POLICE OFFICER) \"Don't give me any of that smart talk nigga, or I'll haul your ass down to jail right now.\"\nAiight, I got somethin' for you...\n(Automatic gunfire)\nSmoked his ass, that's why I'm livin'\nLater on that night, the news:\n(TV reporter) \"Black youth kills police officer in the Bronx. Details at 11.\"\nSee that shit? It's already on TV\nBut if it was me, you would have never seen that shit get live on the air\nThe motherfuckers don't care\nThat's why I live by the trigger\nYou know why...cause I'm a Bronx nigga\nI'm a Bronx nigga, I'm a Bronx nigga (x3)",
