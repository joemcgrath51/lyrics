Diddy\nYou know I got the key to your city\nUnlock the door, rock some more\nBeats we lace\nBad Boy heat the place\nWe run R&B too cuz we keep the faith\nGivin the streets a taste\nBlaze the charts\n\nI remember\n\nIn case you forgot\nFirst Lady B making it hot\nAin't nobody taking the spot\nNow it's Faith instead of pain\nComing through with a better grain\nIn the dash, cell phone better range\nGet the cash, and stock paper for the whole four quarters\nDamn, some things never change\nCan ya feel me? Ya feel me? Let's make 'em dance\nLet's go\nRepeat 1\nHave a good time\nLay back, relax\nJust free your mind\nLet the music take control of you\nRepeat 1 until fade",
