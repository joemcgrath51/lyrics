 "lyrics": "I got another gang story to tell\nPeep, about how a black nigga was born in hell\nAnd right then and there it's no hope\nCause a nigga can't escape the gangs and the dope\nDamn! And when its black on black, that makes it shitty\nCan't survive in the Compton city\nAnd fool thats bet\nCause when you grow up in the hood, you gots ta claim a set\nChyeah, Its not that you want to but you have to\nDon't be a mark, cause niggas might laugh you\nStraight off the mutherfuckin block\nCan't deal with bustas so they asses get clocked\nChyeah, who gives a fuck about another\nOnly got love for my fuckin gang brothers\nChyeah but I'm young so nobody would wonder\nThat the hood would take me under\n\nAlways strapped and eager to peel a cap\nThe hood done took me under\nAlways strapped and eager to peel a cap\nThe hood done took me under\n\nNow I'm a few ages older\nGot hair on my nuts and I'm a little bit bolder\nAnd puttin in work, I has to do my fuckin part\nI'm down for the hood and its planted in the heart\nFool. At school slappin on the girls asses\nFuck the white education so I skip a lot of classes\nCause ain't no teaching a nigga white reality\nTeach me the mutherfuckin gang mentality\nPop pop pop, drops the sucker\nIf he's from another hood I gots ta shoot the mutherfucker\nChyeah I'm in it to win it and can't quit\nFool, and ready die for this shit\nOne times can't fade the gang tuff\nPutting my foot in your ass to make times rough\nI'm the neighborhood terror but I never wondered\nThat the hood would take me under\n\nAlways strapped and eager to peel a cap\nThe hood done took me under\nAlways strapped and eager to peel a cap\nThe hood done took me under\nPolice is hot, but I'm watching my back...\nThe hood done took me under\nPolice is hot, but I'm watching my back...\nThe hood done took me under\n\nI guess I'll watch my back cause niggas jeffin'\nTimes heard this brother pulled a 187\nWho I thought was my homie dropped the dime\nSo I gotta peel his cap with the nine\nFool, if its on then its on, fuck ya G\nBecause how the odds are looking fool, its either him or me\nSo I loads up the strap and I step\nCause my brain cells are dead and all I think is death\nRevenge. Chyeah, that's what its all about\nSee the sucker, take the mutherfucker out\nStare the fool down with the eye contact\nHe try to swing so I draw on him with the gatt\nBlast was the sound that one times heard uh\nNigga, twenty-five to life for the murder\nWas it worth it I've always wondered\nMaybe if the hood didn't take me under\n\nChyeah, this going out to all the niggas\nIt's going out to my niggas\nIts going out to all the niggas\nMy nigga Mike T",
