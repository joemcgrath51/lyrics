 "lyrics": "I remember when\nI remember, I remember when I lost my mind\nThere was something so pleasant about that place\nEven your emotions had an echo, in so much space\nAnd when you're out there without care\nYeah, I was out of touch\nBut it wasn't because I didn't know enough\nI just knew too much\n\nDoes that make me crazy?\nDoes that make me crazy?\nDoes that make me crazy?\nProbably\n\nAnd I hope that you are having the time of your life\nBut think twice, that's my only advice\nCome on now, who do you\nWho do you, who do you, who do you think you are?\nHa, ha, ha, bless your soul\nYou really think you're in control?\n\nWell, I think you're crazy\nI think you're crazy\nI think you're crazy\nJust like me\n\nMy heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb\nAnd all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them\nEver since I was little\nEver since I was little, it looked like fun\nAnd it's no coincidence I've come\nAnd I can die when I'm done\n\nBut maybe I'm crazy\nMaybe you're crazy\nMaybe we're crazy\nProbably",
