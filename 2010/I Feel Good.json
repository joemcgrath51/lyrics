Mmm\nDebonaire, sexy with so much charm\nYeah, I'm talkin' to you\nSo let's go, let me make you smile with my charisma\nLead you to the floor\nLet's dance like we know everybody's watchin' (Hey)\n'Cause that's what we're here for\n\nI feel good like the moon is shinin' just for me\nTonight I'm fly as I can be\nDon't you try to bring me down, though\nIt's not like you could\nI feel too damn good\nSay, ooh, ooh\nI feel too damn good\nSay, ooh, ooh\n\nBack off of me, that negativity\nDon't wanna hear what you say\nI'm gonna dance away my drama\nSo you best get out my way, hey hey\n\nI feel good like the moon is shinin' just for me\n(The moon is shining just for me)\nTonight I'm fly as I can be\n(Tonight I'm fly as I can be)\nDon't you try to bring me down, though\nIt's not like you could\n(It's not like you could, feels good)\nI feel good like the moon is shinin' just for me\n(The moon is shining just for me)\nTonight I'm fly as I can be\n(Tonight I'm fly as I can be)\nDon't you try to bring me down, though\nIt's not like you could\n(Not like you could)\nI feel too damn good\nSay, ooh, ooh\nI feel too damn good\nSay, ooh, ooh\nOoh...",
