 "lyrics": "See, them other crews could not figure me\nIt's the Mag and double-ooh, got that fat CD\nBuck a crystal, hit a nigga with my blunt Philly\nFake MC's getting gassed like they eatin chili\nOnly way they seem to rap is if they got a Philly\nMaybe I'm Nicole Brown, cause you really kill me\nGot away with hittin me, but you ain't O.J\nI'm bout to shake up the world like Cassius Clay\nWhen I bumble watch your back cause I sting like bee\nThis ain't the Wild Wild West and you ain't Kool Moe Dee\nWatch a movie now you think that you really Joe Pesci\nYou don't want beef with me, like a diaper I'm messy\n\nI'm that laid back brother they call Timbaland\nI drive a 850 sometimes a 3-2 Mazda van\nYou can catch me standin in my b-boy stance\nOr catch me at home watching 'Who's the Man'?\nThey call Robert, cause I pack much heat\nOr call me now, because they dig the way I speaks\nI'm like a genie, because I've been trapped in a bottle\nI've got more stunts, than that nigga Desperado\nCome follow, a mad brother with ?*unintelligible*?\nTomorrow, you be sayin, when can we meet? Uhh uhh\nMy offices hours are nine to five\nAin't that right Maganoo, Maganoo? Right... right\nChorus: Magoo\nWhen the clock strikes, half past two, yeah\nThey'll be dancin, through the night\nDa-da-da, da, da (HEY!)\nDa-da-da, da, da (AHH!)\nDa-da-da, da, da (HEY!)\nDa da daahhhhhh! (AHH!)\n(repeat with hey's and ahh's added in regularly throughout)\n\nNow gimme that...(Boom boom vroom vroom)\nAnd run with the... (AHH)\nParty people are you ready for Tim and Maganoo\nAs we come, rum & coke, won't you kick a verse too\n\nYo I'm bout to get it started like I'm Hammer, then I farted\nYou retarded if you thinkin Brandy really broken hearted\nI departed doin dirt, looking up your girl's skirt\nKeep it Steve Martin style, bustin loose like jerk\nI get Up like -town, gimme don't say no more\nGot them scars on my face cause my health be poor\nYou Milli Vanilli, I'm Kurtis Blow like eighty-fo'\nNo I don't want your girl she be suckin my big toe\nYou get death like row, I take a beanie then I jet\nPeace to 2Pac, cause he was dope as it get\nTwisted but you ain't Keith Sweat and shit got hot\nMake a block then make a circle then I rock that spot\nThe rap phenom, I make a dyke go straight\nIf you think I'm cute, then you up too late\nMake no mistake, I'm a question with no answer\nRiddle me like the Joker get burnt like JoJo dancer\nChorus 2X\n(hey's and ahh's continue for a bit without Magoo)\nChorus 1/2",
