 "lyrics": "It's a thin line, it's 5 o'clock in the morning\nAnd I'm just getting in, I knock on the door\nA voice sweet and low says, who is it?\nShe opens up the door and lets me in\nNever do she once say, sir, where have you been?\nNo, she says, are you hungry?\nAre you hungry, honey?\nDid you eat yet?\nLet me hang up your coat, your coat, your coat\nAnd the woman tells me, pass me your hat too\nAll the time she smiles, never raises her voice\nIt's 5 o'clock in the morning\n\nIt's a thin line between love and hate\nIt's a thin line between love and hate\nIt's a thin line between love and hate\n\nThe sweetest woman in the world\nCan be the meanest woman in the world\nIf you make her that way\nYou keep on hurting her\nShe keeps being quiet\nShe might be holding something inside\nThat'll really really hurt you one day\nHere I am laying in the hospital\nBandaged from feet to head\nYa see I'm in the state of shock baby\nJust that much from being dead\nI didn't think my woman could do something like this to me\nI didn't think she had the nerve, so here I am\nI guess action speaks louder than words\n\nIt's a thin line between love and hate\nIt's a thin line between love and hate\nIt's a thin line between love and hate\n\nThe sweetest woman in the world\nCan be the meanest woman in the world\nIf you make her that way\nYou keep on hurting her\nShe keeps being quiet\nShe might be holding something inside\nThat could hurt you one day\n\nIt's a thin line between love and hate\nIt's a thin line between love and hate\nIt's a thin line between love and hate\n\nIt's a thin line (It's a thin line)\nBetween love and hate (You know it is)\nIt's a thin line\nShoobie-dab shoobie-dab shoobie-dab thin line\nIt's a thin line (It's a thin line)\nBetween love and hate (You know it is)\nIt's a thin line\nShoobie-dab shoobie-dab shoobie-dab thin line\nIt's a thin line\nBetween love and hate\nIt's a thin line\nShoobie-dab shoobie-dab shoobie-dab thin line",
