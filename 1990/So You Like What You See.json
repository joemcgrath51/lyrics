 "lyrics": "Get with the program!\nGet with the program!\nGet with the program!\nEveryday now i can feel you watching me from afar\nAnd you been leavin' those love letters on my car (everyday)\nSo now i wonder - why you're so into me in such a way\nThat you've got to take your spare time to chase after me\n(punishing)\nChorus:\nSo you like what you see?\nYou better put a hold on me\nSo you like what you see?\nYou better put a hold on me\nThe problem, baby\nI'm not used to girls to shy (talk to me)\nNow i'm impressed by sweet young ladies on a mission\nTo please their guy\nSo why, young lady, fall short of getting me?\nAbout awhile\nNow it's time you get with the program and learn to leave\nForcefully\nChorus 2x\nIntermission\nChorus until fade",
