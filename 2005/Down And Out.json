'Ye! C'mon!\n\nAyo, street mergers, I legislated; the nerve, I never hated\nOn murders, premeditated\u2014absurd! I hesitated\nObserve: cock and spray, hit you from a block away\nDrinking sake on a Suzuki; we in Osaka Bay\nPlaying soccer, stupid, stay in a sucker's place\nPluck your ace, take your girl, fuck her face\nShe dealing with Killa, so you love her taste\nShe swallowing Killa 'cause she love the taste\nI got brought up with crooking, kitchen orders that I'm cooking\nBut got caught up with the juxes\nYou would've thought I was from Brooklyn\nIt gets boring just looking\nDid like Bill Cosby, pouring in the pudding\nNow, the dashboard is wooden from a hard-tangled grammar\nInterior, inferior; Star-Spangled Banner\nCar game bananas, mob manning tanners\nGuns everywhere, like the car came with hammers, he's back\n\nThey trying to say he (I'm down, down)\nI hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)\nBut our flow is the truest (Oh), the game's in the nooses (No no)\nOur girls is the models (Oh), they coochies the juiciest (Ooooh)\nYeah, they say he (I'm down, down)\nYeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)\n'Cause I'm back on my grind (Oh), money back on my mind (No no)\nYe and Killa Cam, the world is mine (Oooh)\n\nI treat bitches straight up, like Simon Says\nOpen vagina; put your legs behind your head\nCop me Air Ones, hon, lime and red\nYou got pets? Me too: mines are dead, doggy\nFox, minks, gators, that's necessary\nAccessories, my closet's \nPet Sematary\nI get approached by animal activists\nI live in a zoo,\n I run scandals with savages\nAll my niggas get together to gather loot\nBodyguard for what? Dog, I'd rather shoot\nI go to war, old Timbs, battered boots\nHand grenade, goggles and a parachute\nY'all don't even know the name of my flip\nIt was \"Touch Me, Tease Me\" when Case was the shit\nYou don't know bout the cases I get:\nCourt case, briefcase, suitcase, cases of Cris', oww!\n\nThey trying to say he (I'm down, down)\nI hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)\nBut our flow is the truest (Oh), the game's in the nooses (No no)\nOur girls is the models (Oh), they coochies the juiciest (Ooooh)\nYeah, they say he (I'm down, down)\nYeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)\n'Cause I'm back on my grind (Oh), money back on my mind (No no)\nYe and Killa Cam, the world is mine (Oooh)\n\nUgh, Killa, yo, yo, ayo\u2014\nYou dealing with some sure shit, my bitches pure thick\nPlay razor tag, slice your face, you're it!\nIt's I who come by, drive-thru\nGator-toed Mauri, three quarters, sky-blue\nLook at mami: eyes blue, 5'2''\nI approached her\u2014\"Hi, boo, how you?\nPony skin Louie? Oh, you fly too\nYou a stewardess? Good, ma\u2014I fly too\"\nNow, a nigga got baking to bake\nHarlem shake? Nah, I'm in Harlem shaking the weight\nShaking to bake, shaking the Jakes\nKill you, shoot the funeral up and Harlem Shake at your wake\nJust your picture, though; you still taped in a lake\nI'm laughing;\n you couldn't wait to escape\nFor anyone who owed the dough, I had to load the four\nI hope a nigga heard when I said \"I told you so\"\nUgh, Killa!\n\nThey trying to say he (I'm down, down)\nI hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)\nBut our flow is the truest (Oh), the game's in the nooses (No no)\nOur girls is the models (Oh), they coochies the juiciest (Ooooh)\nYeah, they say he (I'm down, down)\nYeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)\n'Cause I'm back on my grind (Oh), money back on my mind (No no)\nYe and Killa Cam, the world is mine (Oooh)\n\nMine! Killa!\nYou already know Harlem\nWhole Midwest, Detroit, Naptown, St. Louis\nChicago, of course\nWestside, holla at me\nSouthside, wild hundreds\nYou know what it is, Ohio\nColumbus, holla at your boy\nYou know what else I do:\nDayton, Youngstown, Cleveland, Cincinnati",
