 "lyrics": "Tears rolling down your face\nAnd your heart feelin' like it's gon' break\nAnd your earth feels like it's 'bout to shake\nAnd you've taken all that you can take\nJust remember where your help comes from\nRealizing you got somewhere to run\nDon't worry 'bout what you're going through\nInstead of worrying, here's what you can do\nPraise him anyway\nIn the middle of it\nIn the middle of it\nIn the middle of it\nYou should praise him anyway\nIn the middle of it\nIn the middle of it\nIn the middle of it\nListen\nI'm just like you\nIf you cut me I'm 'gon bleed\nI got wants just as well as I got needs\nI've been hungry and not had no food to eat\nAnd been knocked down as soon as I got on my feet\nLord it was You that helped me understand\nAnd it was You that never let go of my hand\nI promise that I'll always give you praise\nNo matter what this world brings my way\nI'll praise you anyway\nIn the middle of it\nIn the middle of it\nIn the middle of it\nI'm gonna lift my hands\nIn the middle of it\nIn the middle of it\nIn the middle of it\nI'm gonna do my dance\nIn the middle of it\nIn the middle of it\nIn the middle of it\nI'm gonna shout for joy\nIn the middle of it\nIn the middle of it\nIn the middle of it\nNow clap your hands now\nOooh, you've got that righ\nAnd do your dance now\nRight in the middle of it\nI'll praise Him anyway\nOn every situation\nPut Him in the middle of it\nNo matter what you're going through\nThe battle is not yours,  is the Lord's\nIf you're sick you should praise\nIf you're hurt\nIf you're broke\nIf you're down you should praise\nWhatever you're going through\nJust praise\nHe knows what you're going through\nPraise\nPraise\nComm'on clap your hands\nRight there\nRight there\nComm'on and do  your dance\nBelieve it or not\nGod in Heaven's throne is waiting for all this people\nOoooh ye, oohohoh yee\nClap your hands now",
