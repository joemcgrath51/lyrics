Tell me when to go\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go\nGo dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb\n\nOoh. Jesus Christ had dreads, so shake em\nI ain't got none, but I'm planning on growing some\nImagine all the Hebrews going dumb\nDancing on top of chariots and turning tight ones\nOoh, tell me when to go (dumb)\nTalking on my Ghettro on the way to the store\nMy second or third trip\nSome Henny, some Swishers and some Listerine strips\nDr. Greenthumb lips, just to ease my thoughts\nNot just the cops, but the homies you got to watch\nThe moon is full, look at the dark clouds\nSitting in my scraper, watching Oakland Gone Wild, ta-dow\nI don't bump mainstream, I knock underground\nAll that other shit, sugarcoated and watered down\nI'm from the Bay where we hyphy and go dumb\nFrom the soil where them rappers be getting their lingo from\n\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go\nDumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go\nDumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb\n\nI'm off that 18 dummy juice\nNigga, Raggaman, labeled the Black Zeus\nKing of the super duper hyphy (hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy)\nPipey in your wifey, you don't like me\n(Like me, like me, like me, like me)\nFrom the Bay to the A\nPut me in a Backwood, Swisher sweet blunt, orange lace\n(Let's go, it's dope) It's just some shit I wrote\nMy city couldn't be saved by John the Pope (John the Pope)\nI slid past on the gas with the bitches at me\nIt's good, it's good like the granddaddy\nCross game, you get flipped like a burger patty\nOr zig-zagged, pass me a big old fatty\nI drink white, with a snow bunny\nTalking big shit in the scraper, going hella dummy\n1800, Jose Cuervo\nYadadamean? Yadada I'm saying though?\n\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go\nDumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go\nDumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb\n\nNow let me direct traffic for a minute\n(talk to 'em)\nNow, let me tell you about this hyphy movement we got going in the Bay\nWhen I say something you say it right back to me, you smell me?\nWe're gonna do it like this right here\nGhostride the whip, ghostride the whip\nGhostride the whip, ghostride the whip\nNow scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape\nNow scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape\nPut your stunna shades on\nPut your stunna shades on\nPut your stunna shades on\nPut your stunna shades on\nNow gas, brake, dip, dip\nGas, brake, dip, dip\nShake them dreads, shake them dreads\nShake them dreads, shake them dreads\nLet me see you show your grill, let me see you show your grill\nLet me see you show your grill, let me see you show your grill\nNow thizz face, thizz face\nThizz face, thizz face\nDoors open, mayne\nDoors open, mayne\nDoors open, mayne\nDoors open, mayne\nNow watch em swang, watch em swang\nNow watch em swang, watch em swang\nGo stupid, go dumb, dumb\nGo stupid, go dumb, dumb\n\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go\nDumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go\nTell me when to go... Tell me when to go\nDumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb",
