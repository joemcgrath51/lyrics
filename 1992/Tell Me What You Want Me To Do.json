 "lyrics": "I love you, girl\nYou called me up\nAnd I came to see you\nYou say you've been awake all night\nIt hurts me deep inside\nWhen I see you crying\nWhatever's wrong\nI'll make it right\n\nIf you understand how I feel\nYou should know that my love is real\n\nTell me what you want me to do\nMy love is always here for you\nTell me what you want me to do\nMy love is always here for you\nSo tell me what you want me to do\n\nTell me, girl\nThere were times when I didn't show it\nJust how much I care for you\nI'm so sorry\nNow don't keep saying it's too late\nTo think it's over, baby\nAfter all that we've been through\n\nGirl, I'm begging you\nI'm down on my knees\nDon't walk away, baby\nPlease don't leave me now\n\nTell me what you want me to do\nMy love is always here for you\nTell me what you want me to do\nMy love is always here for you\nSo tell me what you want me to do\n\nGirl, I know that we can work it out somehow\nIsn't that what love is all about\nI'm gonna be by your side\nWe're gonna see it through this time\nI won't let you slip away\nSay you'll stay with me\nStay with me, girl\n'Cause you're the finest girl\nThat I've ever seen\n\nTell me\nTell me what you want me to do, baby\nMy love is only here for you and only you\nTell me what you want me to do\nMy love is always here for you\nSo tell me what you want me to do\nSo tell me what you want me to do",
