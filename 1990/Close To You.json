 "lyrics": "She was a Jezebel\nMiss Brixton queen\nLiving her life like a bad sweet dream\nTelling me lies when the truth was clear\nI think she knew what I wanted to hear\nSpinning around\nLike a wheel on fire\nWalking the tightrope on love's highwire\nA fatal attraction is where I'm at\nThere's no escaping me\n\nI just wanna be close to you\nAnd do all the things you want me to\nI just wanna be close to you\nAnd show you the way I feel\n\nI feel love\nWhen I'm lying in the midnight hour\nHolding you's just like a dream\nLove is never what it seems\nWhen we touch\nAnd you're holding me the way you feel\nGirl, you make my dreams come true\nYou make my dreams come true\n\nI just wanna be close to you\nAnd do all the things you want me to\nI just wanna be close to you\nAnd show you the way I feel\n\nShe was a Gemini on the cusp of Mars\nShe holds me back\nBut she goes too far\nWinding me up just to let me down\nSo emotional\nGagged and bound\nThere's more to this than meets the eye\nA devil woman locked inside\nWith the formal rising\nI was scared\nI think I was possesed\n\nI just wanna be close to you\nAnd do all the things you want me to\nI just wanna be close to you\nAnd show you the way I feel\nI feel love\nEverytime your body's next to mine\nSomethin' deep inside of me\nWants to love you endlessly\nWhen we touch\nGirl, you don't know\nHow it makes me feel\nI just can't believe it's real\nI can't believe it's real!\nI just wanna be close to you\nAnd do all the things you want me to\nI just wanna be close to you\nAnd show you the way I feel\n\nShe had an attitude\nI can't explain\nYou never know if your in flame\nTying me up with elastic words\nI'm on a countdown till I get hurt\nHer blood was hot\nShe burned so bright\nA neon sign there in the night\nIt's hard to say if I went too far\nMy heart still bears a scar\n\nI just wanna be close to you\nI just wanna be close to you\nI just wanna be close to you\n(She was a Jezebel\nThis bursting queen\nLiving her life like a bad sweet dream)\nTelling me lies\nWhen the truth was clear\nI think she knew what I wanted to hear\nI just wanna be close to you\n(Spinning around like a wheel on fire)\nWalkin' the tightrope on love's highwire\nA fatal attraction is where I'm at\nThere's no escaping me\nI wanna be close to you\nAnd do all the things you want me to\nI just wanna be close to you\n(I just wanna be close to you, baby)\nAnd show you the way I feel\nI just wanna be close to you\nAnd do all the things you want me to\nI just wanna be close to you\nAnd show you the way I feel",
