Gon' let it sink in\nHere for the weekend, thinkin' we can\nSee where we could be if we press fast forward\nJust one more round, if you\u2019re down, i\u2019m pouring\nFill another cup up, feelin' on your butt, what\nYou don't even care now, I was unaware how\nFine you was before my buzz set in\nMy buzz set in\n\nBlame it on the Goose, gotcha feelin' loose\nBlame it on the 'Tr\u00f3n, got you in the zone\nBlame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol\nBlame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol\nBlame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny\nBlame it on the blue tap got you feeling dizzy\nBlame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol\nBlame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol\n\nOopsie, she spilled some drink on me\nAnd now I'm knowin' she tipsy\nShe put her body on me\nAnd she keeps staring me right in my eyes\nNo tellin' what I'm gon' do\nBaby I would rather show you\nWhat you been missin' in your li-i-i-ife\nWhen I get insi-i-i-ide\n\nGirl what you drinkin'? Gon' let it sink in\nHere for the weekend, thinkin' we can\nSee where we could be if we press fast forward\nJust one more round, if you\u2019re down, I'm pourin'\nFill another cup up, feelin' on your butt, what\nYou don't even care now, I was unaware how\nFine you was before my buzz set in\nMy buzz set in\n\nBlame it on the Goose, gotcha feelin' loose\nBlame it on the 'Tr\u00f3n, got you in the zone\nBlame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol\nBlame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol\nBlame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny\nBlame it on the blue tap got you feeling dizzy\nBlame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol (Uh-huh, T-Pain)\nBlame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol\n\nGirl, I know you feel good, just like you look\nCouple more shots, you open up like a book\nI ain't trippin (Cause I'ma read ya)\nShawty I ain't trippin' (I just wanna please ya)\nI'ma take a shot of Nuvo, shawty then you know\nIt's going down, we can go and kick it like judo\nYou know what I mean\nShawty got drunk, thought it all was a dream\nSo I made her say \"ah, ah-ah\"\nNow she got her hand on my leg\nGot my seats all wet in my ride (All wet in my ride)\nAll over my ride (All over my ride)\nShe look me dead in the eye, eye-eye\nThen my pants got bigger, she already knew what to figure\nHad her lookin' at her boyfriend like, \"Fuck that nigga!\"\n\nBlame it on the Goose, gotcha feelin' loose\nBlame it on the 'Tr\u00f3n, got you in the zone\nBlame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol\nBlame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol\nBlame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny\nBlame it on the blue tap got you feeling dizzy\nBlame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol\nBlame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol\n\nNow to the ballers poppin' bottles with they Henny in they cups\nScreamin', \"Money ain't a thang\", if it ain't, throw it up\nIn the sky (In the sky)\nAnd hold your drinks up high (High)\nAnd to my independent mamas who can buy they own bottles\nIf you lookin' like a model, when them broke fellas holla\nTell 'em, \"Bye\" (Bye)\nAnd hold your drinks up high\n\nYou can blame it on the Goose, gotcha feelin' loose\nBlame it on the 'Tr\u00f3n, got you in the zone\nBlame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol\nBlame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol\nBlame it on the vodka, blame it on the Henny\nBlame it on the blue tap got you feeling dizzy\nBlame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol\nBlame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol",
