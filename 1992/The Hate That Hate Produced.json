 "lyrics": "- Hey Junior, where's everybody going?\n- Man, we's free! We \"finna\" get our freedom\n- What? But Master Thomas been good to us\nWhy we leaving? Why we leaving now?\nThe time for scared, lip-trembling, word-changing\nSelf-denying, compromising\nKnee-shakin' black people is over\nIf you have something to say\nSpeak up with authority and conviction\nIf not, sit down and shut up\nWe have to have the power to tell the truth\nTo say whatever is necessary\nTo do what needs to be done\nWhatever it is, no matter who it may hurt\nTell 'em who I am! C'mon!\nTell 'em who I am! C'mon!\nSouljah was not born to make white people feel comfortable\nI am african first, I am black first\nI want what's good for me and my people first\nAnd if my survival means your total destruction\nThen so be it!\nYou built this wicked system\nThey say two wrongs don't make it right\nBut it damn sure makes it even!\nYeah, you can speak and all of that\nBut can you rhyme, Sister?\nSouljah's creating the statements I'm stating...\nMeant to be real, never accommodating...\nI give it to you straight, I don't water it down...\nNo need to debate, I don't change it around...\nWell if the truth hurts, well then you'll be in pain\nAnd if the truth drives you crazy, you'll die insane\nNow you can tell Ted Koppel, and even Dan Rather\nCameras and light won't affect the matter...\nYeah, I know your nerves are wrecked to hear a woman\nThat's a rebel\nWell, you heard the bass, but Souljah's the treble\nThe experts, the scientists, PhD's\nSouljah pays no homage to a paper degree\nMy mind is mine, my thoughts are a friend to me\nDamn your color and white world supremacy\nGot ya drippin and sweatin, you can't believe what I said\nWait for me to change my mind, hold your breath\nYou'll be dead...\nDead, dead, dead, dead...",
