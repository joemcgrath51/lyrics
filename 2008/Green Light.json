Well, technically no (NO!)\nIf you be my girlfriend, then I'll make it so\nYou'll be my only true lover\nNo competition, no other (no other)\nBaby, it's just, the thrill of the chase\nI've got a feeling, I'm winning this race\nBaby, I'm in much closer\nI just need permission so\n\nGive me the green light\nGive me just one night\nI'm ready to go right now\nI'm ready to go right now\nWe could go all night\nGive me the green light\nI'm ready to go right now\nI'm ready to go right now\n\nOne, two, three - green light\nWell, if it's what it seems like\nThey way you're movin' baby let's me know that's it's gon' be right\nI'm - (I'm ready to go right now) Ah, ah\nI'm - (I'm ready to go right now)\nA-one, two, three - red light\nI wanna see what your bed's like\nBut if I be your buddy, get you studied, is yo' head right?\nI'm - (I'm ready to go right now) Ah, ah\nI'm - (I'm ready to go right now)\n\nSo I went hard like Medusa starin at me\nI told her, \"Let's go, let's blow this lame nigga factory\"\nShe said, \"What kind of girl do you think that I are?\nThe kind that you meet in a bar?\nYou think you can get whatever you want cause you some kind of star\"\nNo, I'm a comet; I just want you woman\nHey, if I were you then it would be me that I'd go home with\nThree, the one and only, one thing you ain't considered\nI heard you when you told your girl, \"Ooh, he can get it\" - admit it\nYou did it! Let's hop a cab, and split it\nI'm kiddin! We both goin' to where you livin'!\nEh-HAH!! I got you giggling like a piglet - oh, that's the ticket?\nI hope you more like, Anita Baker, than Robin Givens\nNo, I don't know that lady, so let me quit it\nI'm just stylefreein', freestylin' which I seldom do\nThis is what I'm tellin' you, to the bed I'm nailin' you\nLike I've been in jail for two, years and then they let me loose\n\nGive me the green light\nGive me just one night\nI'm ready to go right now\nI'm ready to go right now\nWe could go all night\nGive me the green light\nI'm ready to go right now\nI'm ready to go right now\n\nYou got you one, Legend!\nSometimes you gotta step from behind that piano!\nAnd let 'em know what's going on\nEven Stevie Wonder got down sometimes..Hahaha!\nI'm ready to go! My mandate can't wait\nParticipate\n\nI'm ready to go right now\nI'm ready to go right now\nI'm ready to go right now\nI'm ready to go right now",
