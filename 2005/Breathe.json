And it won't stop\n'Til they inhale your seed, and it don't stop\n'Til I tell 'em to breathe like a doctor with a stethoscope\nI don't see no fucking hope, unless these motherfuckers (\nBreathe\n)\n\nYeah, Brooklyn gotta (\nOh\n) Uptown gotta\nThe Bronx gotta, Queens gotta (\nBreathe\n)\nStaten Island gotta, you niggas gotta\nYou bitches gotta, everybody (\nBreathe\n)\nOne and then the two (\nOh\n, two) two and then the three (Three)\nThree and then the four (Four) then you gotta breathe (\nBreathe\n)\nThen you gotta, then you gotta\nBreathe!",
