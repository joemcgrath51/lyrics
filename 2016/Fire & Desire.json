I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'\nLet's just keep it private (Don't say anything)\nTell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?\n'Cause we never decided, tell me how you feel inside\n\nYou a real ass woman and I like it, yeah\nDedicate to you\nI need you inspired, I need you excited\nI don't wanna fight it\n\nYeah-yeah, I figure out you, you figure out me\nWe both a different breed\nI'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need\nYou say, \"A guarantee\"\nI mean, you say that like it's easy\nYou never believe me\nTold you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on 'em\nGirl, I'm sleepy\nSometimes I'm so indecisive\n\nBut you a real ass woman and I like it\nI don't wanna fight it\n\nI give you my fortune\nI dedicate, I dedicate\nI dedicate, I dedicate\nI dedicate, dedicate, dedicate\nI dedicate to you\nI dedicate, I dedicate\nThis song's for you\nI dedicate, I dedicate\nI give you my voice\nThis song's for you",
