I ain't judging\nIf you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight\nWhat? More power to you\nIf you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight\nLe-le-let me dig that out like a fossil\nDamn baby, that ass is colossal\nPilates and milk did that body so good\nYou got in them pants? I wish I could\nHow many drinks would it take you to leave with me?\n (oh, well...)\nYou look good, and we came to party\nBut I don't wanna waste my time\n \n(oh no)\nBack of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three\nAgree? Indeed\nYou look good, and we came to party\nBut I don't wanna waste my time\n\nOr waste your time, or waste your time\nOr waste our time, baby it's alright\nBaby it's alright, baby it's alright yeah\nOh it's alright now\nAlright, oh yeah\nI don't wanna waste my time, no\nI don't wanna waste no time, oh no\nI don't wanna waste your time, babe\nI don't wanna waste our time, oh my time, oh whoa, now\n\nHow many drinks would it take you to leave with me?\n (oh yeah)\nYeah you look good, and I got money\nBut I don't wanna waste my time\n (come wit' me baby)\nBack of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three\n (yeah it's just a short drive home from here)\nYou look good; we came to party\nBut I don't wanna waste my time\n (waste my time)\n\nNo-no-no, I ain't judgin'\nIf you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight\nWhat? More power to you\nIf you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight\nI ain't judgin'\nIf you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight\nWhat? More power to you\nIf you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight\n\nLet's go, shit we only live once right?\nI mean, where's the fun in forever anyway?",
