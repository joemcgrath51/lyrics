 "lyrics": "Niggas be thinkin' I'm deep, intelligent, fooled by my college degree\nMy IQ is average, there's\u2005a\u2005young lady out\u2005there, she way smarter than me\nI\u2005scrolled through her timeline in these wild times, and I\u205fstarted\u205fto\u205fread\nShe mad at\u205fthese crackers, she\u205fmad at these capitalists, mad at these murder police\nShe mad at my niggas, she mad at our ignorance, she wear her heart on her sleeve\nShe mad at the celebrities, lowkey I be thinkin' she talkin' 'bout me\nNow I ain't no dummy to think I'm above criticism\nSo when I see something that's valid, I listen\nBut shit, it's something about the queen tone that's botherin' me\nShe strike me as somebody blessed enough to grow up in conscious environment\nWith parents that know 'bout the struggle for liberation and in turn they provide her with\nA perspective and awareness of the system and unfairness that afflicts 'em\nAnd the clearest understandin' of what we gotta do to get free\nAnd the frustration that fills her words seems to come from the fact that most people don't see\nJust 'cause you woke and I'm not, that shit ain't no reason to talk like you better than me\nHow you gon' lead, when you attackin' the very same niggas that really do need the shit that you sayin'?\nInstead of conveyin' you holier, come help us get up to speed\nShit, it's a reason it took like two hundred years for our ancestors just to get freed\nThese shackles be lockin' the mental way more than the physical\nI look at freedom like trees, can't grow a forest like overnight\nHit the ghetto and slowly start plantin' your seeds\nFuck is the point of you preaching your message to those that already believe what you believe?\nI'm on some \"Fuck a retweet,\" most people is sheep\nYou got all the answers but how you gon' reach?\nIf I could make one more suggestion respectfully\nI would say it's more effective to treat people like children\nUnderstandin' the time and love and patience that's needed to grow\nThis change is inevitable, but ain't none of us seen this before\nTherefore, we just gotta learn everything as we go\nI struggle with thoughts on the daily\nFeel like a slave that somehow done saved enough coins to buy his way up outta slavery\nThinkin' just maybe, in my pursuit to make life so much better for me and my babies\nI done betrayed the very same people that look at me like I'm some kind of a hero\nBecause of the zeros that's next to the commas\nBut look here, I promise I'm not who you think\nRan into this nigga outside of the store yesterday\nHe said something that had me like, \"Wait\"\nHe was like, \"Cole, 'preciate what you been doin', my nigga, that's real\"\nBut damn, why I feel faker than Snow on tha Bluff?\nWell, maybe 'cause deep down I know I ain't doin' enough\n\nThe sun is shinin' today\nThe sun is shinin' today\nThe sun is shinin' today\n\nCan you walk with me?\nI hope we'll find the reason why we often sob, go on, cry\nPainful memories fuck up the vibe\nThough I be tryin' to let the time heal my mind\nI was once a child, I've gotten older\nStill, I know I'm just a boy in God's eyes\nFill me up with wisdom and some courage\nPlus endurance to survive, help mine thrive",
