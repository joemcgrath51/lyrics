 "lyrics": "Do you know everything you do\nHas a reaction in kind\nWhat you give is what you get\nSince the begining of time\nIf you hurt someone it's fair to say\nSooner or later it's comin back your way\nYou can't play games without any risk\nBetter beware and remember this\nWhat goes up must come down\nThe things you do come back around\nI know cause I found\nWhat goes up must come down\nSome people hate and they wonder why\nThings are not better today\nPeople get what they deserve\nMost of the time anyway\nSometimes you win but you could lose\nThat's all right you can't change the rules\nIf it ain't one thing it's gonna be two\nAs long as you live and you know it's true\nWhat goes up must come down\nThe things you do come back around\nI know cause I found\nWhat goes up must come down\nLike the sunshine turn to night\nSometimes you wrong\nSometimes your right\nLet there be no doubt\nIt'll all work out\nWhat goes up must come down\nThe things you do come back around\nI know cause I found\nWhat goes up must come down",
