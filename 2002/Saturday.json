Act like my rims ain't clean\nHow you gon' act like my neck don't bling?\nHaters get sprayed like Afro Sheen\nBut they don't ever really wanna pop them thangs\nCane-cane sugar mane, Luda don't go\nAnd I stopped at a light, pulled off so slow\nBut I'm out for the night, so pass that 'dro\n'Til daddy come home in a Cadillac Brough'm\n(Cadillac Brough'm?) Now don't it sound absurd?\nClaim College Park where they flip them birds\nTrick car alarms then bend them curves\nChop-chop, chunk it up, fat man herb\n\nI got a big weed stash, pocket full of cash\nJust seen a big ol' ass (\nIt's Saturday\n)\nSticky, icky, icky, icky\n (\nOoh-ooh\n)\nSticky, icky, icky, icky\n (\nOoh-ooh\n)\nSystem on blast, cops just pass\nJust seen a big ol' ass (\nIt's Saturday\n)\nSticky, icky, icky, icky\n (\nOoh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\n)\nSticky, icky, icky, icky\n\nIt's illegal, but the plants in my backyard grow\nThat's my buds, smoke 'til ya drop out\nThat's my luck, keep a couple rolled\nAnd I hit the club, in the back door\nNigga, what? Act like I don't make clouds\nHow you gon' act like I don't get loud?\nHow you gon' act like I don't rock crowds\nAnd leave a lot of people with a gap-toothed smile?\nIf I recollect right, then you sound like dirt\nBut I guess what you really don't know don't hurt\nWith a vest and a pump hear the shotgun squirt\nMy folks on the block, man, they got that work\n(They got that work?) Don't it smell so good\nIn Southwest where they rep that hood\nProtect your chest, they up to no good\nAnd come through flossin', they wish y'all would\n\nI got a big weed stash, pocket full of cash\nJust seen a big ol' ass (\nIt's Saturday\n)\nSticky, icky, icky, icky\n (\nOoh-ooh\n)\nSticky, icky, icky, icky\n (\nOoh-ooh\n)\nSystem on blast, cops just pass\nJust seen a big ol' ass (\nIt's Saturday\n)\nSticky, icky, icky, icky\n (\nOoh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\n)\nSticky, icky, icky, icky\n\nWorldwide hustlers, get that dough\nWork that tip, get rid of evidence\nMove that brick, keep a D. Eagle\nWith a extra clip, think it ain't so?\nSuck a dick, act like I just do rap\nHow you gon' act like I just ain't strapped?\nHow you gon' act like I don't push 'Lacs?\nBlack Eldorado, fifth wheel on back\nItchy finger-trigger, man, Luda don't squeeze\nWith a MAC or the Glock I'ma make 'em say please\nAnd I'm back on the block where the cops say, \"Freeze\"\nAnd I'm so high, I think I got a nose bleed\n(You got a nose bleed?) Don't it smell so sweet?\nIn Decatur where they pack that heat\nAnd rob neighbors in the night, creep-creep\nI'll see you later, we'll be in them streets\n\nI got a big weed stash, pocket full of cash\nJust seen a big ol' ass (\nIt's Saturday\n)\nSticky, icky, icky, icky\n (\nOoh-ooh\n)\nSticky, icky, icky, icky\n (\nOoh-ooh\n)\nSystem on blast, cops just pass\nJust seen a big ol' ass (\nIt's Saturday\n)\nSticky, icky, icky, icky\n (\nOoh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\n)\nSticky, icky, icky, icky\nI got a big weed stash, pocket full of cash\nJust seen a big ol' ass (\nIt's Saturday\n)\nSticky, icky, icky, icky\n (\nOoh-ooh\n)\nSticky, icky, icky, icky\n (\nOoh-ooh\n)\nSystem on blast, cops just pass\nJust seen a big ol' ass (\nIt's Saturday\n)\nSticky, icky, icky, icky\n (\nOoh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\n)\nSticky, icky, icky, icky",
