(It's getting late)\nWhy you gotta be here?\nBeside me\nWatching, needing, wanting me\nBut I'm afraid, you say don't be\nBut I'm afraid, and you say don't be\nI'm afraid that you'll gonna hurt me baby, baby twice baby\nGood baby baby baby\n baby baby baby\nOoooh baby\n\nI see the memories replayed, same space, same face\nSame bodies baby\nI know this method to your manliness\nBut I'm afraid, babe\nI see the memories replayed, same space, same face\nSame bodies baby I know this method to your manliness\nBut I'm afraid, baby\nBaby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby\nOh  baby, baby, baby\n\nPlease don't hurt me baby\nI'm afraid, baby\nPlease don't hurt me baby\nI'm afraid, baby\nPlease don't hurt me baby\nPlease don't hurt me\nI'm afraid, babe\nPlease don't hurt me baby\nI'm afraid, babe\nBaby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby",
