 "lyrics": "How did I ever let you slip away\nNever knowing I'd be singing this song some day\nAnd now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more\nEver since you closed the door\n\nIf I could turn, turn back the hands of time\nThen my darling you'd still be mine\nIf I could turn, turn back the hands of time\nThen darling you, you'd still be mine\n\nFunny, funny how time goes by\nAnd blessings are missed in the wink of an eye\nWhy oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering\nWhen every day I pray please come back to me\n\nIf I could turn, turn back the hands of time\nThen my darling you'd still be mine\nIf I could turn, turn back the hands of time\nThen darling you, you'd still be mine\n\nAnd you had enough love for the both of us\nBut I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did\nBut now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa\n\nIf I could turn, turn back the hands of time\nThen my darling you'd still be mine\nIf I could turn, turn back the hands of time\nThen darling you, you'd still be mine\nOh I'd never hurt you (If I could turn back)\nNever do you wrong (If I could turn back)\nAnd never leave your side (If I could turn back)\nIf I could turn back the hands\nThere'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you (If I could turn back)\nForever honest and true to you (If I could turn back)\nIf you accept me back in your heart, I love you (If I could turn back the hands)\n(If I could turn back)\nOh oh, that would be my will\n(If I could turn back)\nDarling I'm begging you to take me by the hands\n(If I could turn back the hands)\nI'm going down, yes I am\n(If I could turn back)\nDown on my bended knee, yeah\n(If I could turn back)\nAnd I'm gonna be right there until you return to me\n(If I could turn back the hands) Oh oh oh\n(If I could turn back)\nIf I could just turn back that little clock on the wall\n(If I could turn back)\nThen I'd come to realize how much I love you\nLove you, love you, love you, love you\n(If I could turn back the hands, If I could turn back the hands)\n(oh oh oh oh)",
