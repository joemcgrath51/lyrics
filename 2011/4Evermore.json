We back again\nI shine, you shine\nI shine, you shine\nForever, eva\nForever, eva\nForever, eva, eva, eva\n\nForever more\nForever's a mighty long time but I really wanna spend it with you\nI shine when you shine and there's really no substitute\nForever more\nForever's a mighty long time but I really wanna spend it with you\nI shine when you shine and there's really no substitute\nForever more\n\nTake a picture, I want you to remember\nWhen I professed my love\nPress the button, I hope it's still recording\nEvery word I'm saying to you\nI'm telling you right now from this day on\nAlready weighed out the pros and cons\nTellin' ya, you're just the woman I want (I want)\nI want (I want), I want (I want)\nMaking my plans just to be with you\nIt's you and me, babe, 'til the days are through\nAnd I ain't ashamed, love, to say I do\nI do (I do), hey, hey\n\nForever more\nForever's a mighty long time but I really wanna spend it with you\nI shine when you shine and there's really no substitute\nForever more\nForever's a mighty long time but I really wanna spend it with you\nI shine when you shine and there's really no substitute\nForever more\n\nPick a tree to carve our names\nLet the world know it's not a game\nLasts longer than a wedding ring\nGenerations tattooed with the love we bring\nFrom the seeds we sow\nTo the time it takes to grow\nLong enough to show you\nI won't let go of you\n'Cause without you I'm incomplete\nLike this love song without this beat\nI'm saying that you are the man I need (I need)\nI need (I need), I need (yeah-heey)\nI'm making my plans just to be with you\nIt's you and me, babe, 'til the days are through\nAnd I ain't ashamed, love, to say I do (I do)\nI do (I do) I do\n\nForever more\nForever's a mighty long time but I really wanna spend it with you\nI shine when you shine and there's really no substitute\nForever more\nForever's a mighty long time but I really wanna spend it with you\nI shine when you shine and there's really no substitute\nForever more\n\nUh, yeah, it's Phontigga, yo\nTake a picture off the wall, try to reframe it\nTake all the color off, try to repaint it\nIf you want picture perfect, well, we ain't it\nBecause we painted our own portrait\nOf me and you that could never be tainted\nBecause real love embodies all colors of the spectrum\nMix a few greens with your reds and your blues\nCreate some new hues, then you rehang it\nStart over, even though your friends gon' doubt you\nAnd all them other niggas tryna scout you\nIt gets so tiring, but I'd be lying\nIf I said that I'd be better off without you\nAnd when I think of walking out you\nSmile in a way that make me feel like I'd be lost without you\nMe and you are the only threats to us\n'Til death do us, I'm standing next to ya\n\nForever more\nForever's a mighty long time but I really wanna spend it with you\nI shine when you shine and there's really no substitute\nForever more\nForever's a mighty long time but I really wanna spend it with you\nI shine when you shine and there's really no substitute\nForever more",
