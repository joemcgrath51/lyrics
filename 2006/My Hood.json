 "lyrics": "Every time I do it I do it for my hood\nAnd every time I do it I do it for yo hood\nAnd every time I do it I do it for they hood\nIt's understood I do it for the hood\n\nThe streets love Jeezy and I love 'em back\nIf I still had work I'd front ya a sack\nIt's all gravy still reaching wit my words\nAnd make 'em feel good like the \nfirst and the third\nTake you back when I was sixteen wit a bankroll\nPosted on a corner like a light pole\nThey used to call us track stars\nBefore they even stopped we ran to dem cars\nAnd everybody on the block got the same agenda\nHustle from the beginning of January til the end of December\nWasn't smokin purple then it was more like bobby brown\nOn that hen dog straight got a nigga drinking brown (7/11 nigga you know)\nYou know 10 to 4 shake 'em up talk shit get my drink and let 'em go\nEven when I'm on the road the gangstas stay in touch\nWhy the fuck you think they love me so much? (Ha ha!)\n\n\nI'm talking bout summertime cookouts and wintertime flights\nIt ain't nothing we hearing shots all night\nFord Taurus pulls up everybody run\nWhite boys jump out pointing wit they guns (5-0, 5-0)\nFord Taurus leave everybody came back\nHope dem boyz didn't find my sack\nReal recognize real I suppose\nI guess that's why the gangstas be at all my shows\nGot the deal nothing changed but my clothes\nStill catch me in the 'jects fuckin wit them hoes (projects!)\nLike coo-coo cal\nLord I wish mad Lou could see me now\nWish Gold Mouth was home, Mel Man was free\nA lot of niggas crossing over dog no not me\nClosest I ever been in the commercial when I watch TV\nAnd everybody know I rep these streets faithfully\n\n\nFord Taurus pull up everybody run\nWhite boys jump out pointing wit they guns\nFord Taurus\n leave everybody came back\nHope dem boyz didn't find my sack",
