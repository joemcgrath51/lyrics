 "lyrics": "All alone on a Sunday mornin'\nOutside I see the rain is fallin', whoa oh\nInside I'm slowly dyin'\nBut the rain will hide my cryin', cryin', cryin'\nAnd you...\n\nDon't you know my tears will burn the pillow\nSet this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies\nAll I needed was a simple \"Hello\"\nBut the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry\n\nI...\nI gave you my love in vain\nMy body never knew such pleasure\nMy heart never knew such pain\nAnd you...\nYou leave me so confused\nNow I'm all cried out\nOver you\n\n(Ooh, I'm over you, oh yeah you, yes)\n\nNever wanted to see things your way, I had to go astray\nOh, why was I such a fool, baby\n(Why was I such a fool) Oh, yeah\nNow I see that the grass is greener\nIs it too late for me to find my way home?\nHow could I be so wrong?\nLeavin' me all alone\n\nDon't you know my tears will cause an inferno\nTears will cause an inferno, baby\nRomance often fades, why should I take the blame?\nWhy should... why should I?\nYou were the one who left me neglected\nOh, I'm so sorry, baby\nApology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you've collected\n\nI... (Whoa)\nI gave you all of me (I gave you all of me)\nHow was I to know\nYou would weaken so easily\nI...\nI don't know what to do (I don't know what to do)\nNow I'm all cried out (I'm all cried out)\nOver you\n\nI...\nI gave you my love in vain\nMy body never knew such pleasure\nMy heart never knew such pain\nAnd you... (Left me so confused)\nNow I'm all cried out (I'm all cried out)\nNow I'm all cried out (All cried out)\nI'm so sorry, baby\nOver you\n\nYes, I'm so sorry\nPlease forgive me\nOh-oh, whoo!\nPlease forgive me, lady",
