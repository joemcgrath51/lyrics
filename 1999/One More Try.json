 "lyrics": "I've had enough of danger\nAnd people on the streets\nI'm looking out for angels\nJust trying to find some peace\nNow I think it is time\nThat you let me know\nSo if you love me\nSay that you love me\nBut if you don't\nJust let me go\nChorus:\n'Cuz teacher\nThere are things that I don't want to learn\nAnd the last one I had made me cry so I\nDon't want to hold you, touch you\nDon't think that you're mine\nBecause it ain't no\nWorld for an uptown girl whose teacher has told\nHer goodbye, goodbye, goodbye\nWhen you were just a stranger\nAnd I was at you feet\nI didn't feel the danger\nNow I feel the heat\nThat look in your eyes\nTelling me no\nSo you think that you love me\nKnow that you need me\nI wrote the song, I know it's wrong\nJust let me go\n(chorus)\nSo when you say that you need me\nThat you'll never leave me\nI know you're wrong, you're not that strong\nLet me go\nAnd teacher\nThere are things that I don't want to learn\nAnd the last one I had made me cry so I\nDon't want to learn to hold you, touch you\nThink that you're mine because it ain't no\nWorld for an uptown girl\nWho just isn't willing to try\nI'm so cold inside\nMaybe just one more try",
