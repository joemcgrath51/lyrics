 "lyrics": "What if a woman\nHad a man on the side\nAnd she never spent time with you\nWhat if a woman\nSaid she's working late\nAnd it's always the same excuse\nWhat if a woman\nTook the keys to your whip\nSaid I'll be right back, don't trip\nWhat if a woman\nLeft you home with the kids\nChanging diapers and shit\nWhat a twist\n\nCould you stand inside her shoes and walk a mile?\n(I don't really think so)\nCould you hold her down when she doesn't smile?\n(I don't know a man who could)\nWhat if a woman, what if a woman\nWhat if a woman was just like you?\nWhat if a woman, what if a woman\nWhat if a woman was just like you?\nWhat if a woman, what if a woman\nWhat if a woman was just like us?\nWhat if a woman, what if a woman\nWhat if a woman\nCould you ever wonder if she does?\n\nWhat if a woman\nStarted wearing the pants\nWould you feel less of a man and more\nWhat if a woman\nNever wanna settle down\nAlways wanna run around on the low\nYou can beg, you can plead, you can cry\nShe won't be your wife\nBut your eyes are full of tears\nShe'll be running the streets\nWith girls hanging out tonight\nIt's the same thing you do to her\n\n\nIf the table were turned around\nWould you leave? Would you stay?\nWould you drown?\nIf the cards you were dealt were to change\nWould you let your hand go up in flames?\n\nWhat if a woman, what if a woman\nWhat if a woman was just like you?\nWhat if a woman, what if a woman\nWhat if a woman was just like you?\nWhat if a woman, what if a woman\nWhat if a woman was just like us?\nWhat if a woman, what if a woman\nWhat if a woman\nCould you ever wonder if she does?",
