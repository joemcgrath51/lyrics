 "lyrics": "This is the city where I live\nThese are the friends that I have made\nBefore I\u2005hang\u2005these aching heels\u2005behind\nI'd love to make amends\nAnd think\u2005of all the time we\u2019ve spent\nDying on this piano bench\nI know when I come home again\nYou won't be waiting in the wings\nThey used to keep a bucket on the side of the stage\nWhere is the bottle Linda left me?\nShould I be here at my age in your swimming pool?\nIn your swimming pool, Brian Jones?\nAll of these changes I'm feeling\nAre tying ropes to the ceiling\nAnother dream, another night\nHow can you sleep with all these girlfriends around here?\nThey\u2019re not like yours at all\nThey understand the sickness too\nI'm in the scene, I smell chlorine, I'm clean for you\nThey used to keep a dolly on the side of the stage\nWhere are the pills that Linda left me?\nShould I be here at my age in your swimming pool?\nIn your swimming pool, Brian Jones?",
