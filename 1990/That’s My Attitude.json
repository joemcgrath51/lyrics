 "lyrics": "That's my attitude\nHello\nWho is this\nBaby do you realize what time it is\nWhat's up/Nothing's up\nI'm asleep\nWait a minute\nI thought you weren't talking to me no more\nRemember just the other day you were fronting on me\nTalking about my head was big now that I'm making records\nYou now what I'm saying\nOh/ when did you make that change\nWell listen/ I got things to do\nYou know what I'm saying\nYou got to get off my line\nYou know/Straight up\n\nYou say you don't like\nThe way that I am\nFrankly baby\nI don't give a damn\nAfter all the things you put me through\nI'm not gonna take this\nTake this stuff from you\n\nYou say that you can't believe\nThat a man could be so rude\nHey baby, that's my attitude\nYou call me up on my phone\nTelling me, don't be cruel\nHey baby that's my attitude\n\nYou don't understand why I'm acting like this\nYou want me to sit here and explain why?\nListen I'm tired of talking, Yo Allen kick it\n\nI gave you my money\nI gave all my time\nAll you did was mess around with my mind\nThen you go and find you another lover\nI want you to know, payback is a mother\n(Cry, cry, day and night)\nNow you wanna come back\nBut it just isn't like that\nDon't think for a minute\nBaby, I'm not with it\n\nYou say that you can't believe\nThat a man could be so rude\nHey baby, that's my attitude\nYou call me up on my phone\nTelling me, don't be cruel\nHey baby that's my attitude\n\nYou say that you can't believe\nThat a man could be so rude\nHey baby, that's my attitude\nYou call me up on my phone\nTelling me, don't be cruel\nHey baby that's my attitude",
