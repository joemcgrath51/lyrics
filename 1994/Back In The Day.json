(back in the day) When? (back in the day)\n\nI'm still back in the days, but now the year is '87\n'88 that's when my crew and I were in junior high\nIn 7th grade, I hated school (wish it'd blown up)\nNo doubt I couldn't wait to get out (and be a grownup)\nBut let me finish this reminiscing and telling\n'Bout when girls was belling tight corduroys like for the boys\nBasket weaves\n, \nNike Cortez\n, and \nfootsie socks\nAnd eating pickles, with tootsie pops\nAnd it don't stop, I'm glad cause when J.J. Fad hit \nSupersonic\nIt was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts\nOr to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses\nOf hoochies had Poison airbrushed on they asses\nDudes had on Nike suits, and the \nPumas with\nThe fat laces\n cause it was either that or \nK-Swiss\nI miss those days and so I pout like a grown jerk\nWishing all I had to do now, was finish homework\nIt's true, you don't realize really what you got til it's gone\nAnd I'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but\nSometimes I do sit and reminisce then\nThink about the years I was raised, back in the days\n\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\n\nAnd everybody say (I remember way back when)\nAnd everybody say (I remember way back when)\nAnd everybody say (I remember way back when)\nWhat? (back in the day) When? (back in the day)\n\nWell, it's the niggarole\n, I figure that now I'm all grown up\nBecause I'm eighteen years old, \nand guess you could say I'm holding\nDown a steady job\n and crew steady mobbing\nYou steady bobbing your head and I'm paid, so I got it made\nBut, didn't always have clout, \nused to live in South Central L.A\nThat's where I stayed and figured a way out\nI gave it all I had so for what it's worth\nI went from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first\nSo \nAhmad and The Jones'\n is on our way up\nYup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid\nAnd we finally did, but\nSometimes I still sit and reminisce then\nThink about the years I was raised, back in the days\n\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\nBack in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore\nBut some days I sit and wish I was a kid again\n\nAnd everybody say (I remember way back when)\nAnd everybody say (I remember way back when)\nAnd everybody say (I remember way back when)\nWhat? (back in the day) When? (back in the day)",
