 "lyrics": "Nah baby, I'm not gonna be able to do it\nI tried to take you serious before, and you blew it\nYou figured you was slick, dissin me for the next man\nBut when you heard he had a wife, it ruined your plans\nNow you wanna come back and act like it's all that\nBut I ain't tryin to hear it, cause you sound real wack\nYou got it over the first time, but that was the last time\nI'll never make the same mistake again in a lifetime\nYou hooker, no way, no how, you're history\nSo let's keep it real, cause this ain't no mystery\nYou had it like a queen, livin lovely and lost me\nYour props are at all-time low and you crossed me\nI used to treat you good, take you shoppin and feed ya\nBut now I'm doin fine, and girlfriend, I don't need ya\nFor you to even ask me that, you must be stupid\nNah, baby, I'm not gonna be able to do it\n(Can you do it?)\nI'm not gonna be able to do it (8x)\n\nI'm on a mission, and I need me a new girl\nMy last girl fronted fakin moves with Earl\nBut that was in the past, finsihed, over, and done with\nBesides, I know this hottie, and she's on my tip\nShe told me I could call her when I wanted to check her\nAnd all I had to do to knock her down was respect her\nTo think about it, gee, that would be cool\nTo have a girl that's independent, with a job and school\nSo we took it slow, then we started to grow\nWithout a worry in the world, goin right with the flow\nUntil she cracked my head when she asked me to marry her\nAnd move into a crib in some suburbian area\nI knew that this was just too good to be true\nAnd what you're askin me to do, girl, I cannot do\nYou told me, \"No committments\", and you best stick to it\nOh baby, I'm not gonna be able to do it\n\n\nNow I'm makin money, and it's good to be single\nTo mingle with the ladies while their earrings jingle\nAnd that's the way it is, cause that's the way that I want it\nWhen I see a pretty mommy lookin good, I'm on it\nCheckin out her profile to see if she got style\nCause if she ain't a 10, she ain't worth my while\nI'm all about stickin and movin with the quickness\nForget the foreplay, and let's get down to business\n(Yeah, is it good? Is it good, baby?) Damn, my jim hat broke!\nBut still I kept strokin till her boots were smokin\nAnd left her on the bed with her legs wide open\nTryin to kick it to me like she was my girl\nBut yo, I had to tell her, ain't no way in the world\nMaybe it's the way I hit that thing that souped it\nBut no, I'm not gonna be able to do it\n\n(Can you do it?)",
