 "lyrics": "Not more than three short years ago\nI was abandoned and alone\nWithout a penny to my name\nSo very young and so afraid\nNo proper shoes upon my feet\nSometimes I couldn't even eat\nI often cried myself to sleep\n\nBut still I had to keep on going\nNever knowing if I could take it\nIf I would make it through the night\nI held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed\nAnd now I've found my way\n\nIf you believe in yourself enough\nAnd know what you want\nYou're gonna make it happen, make it happen\nAnd if you get down on your knees at night\nAnd pray to the Lord\nHe's gonna make it happen, make it happen\nYou're gonna make it happen, oh, yeah\n\nI know life can be so tough\nAnd you feel like giving up\nBut you must be strong, baby, just hold on\nYou'll never find the answers\nIf you throw your life away\nI used to feel the way you do\n\nStill I had to keep on going\nNever knowing if I could take it\nIf I would make it through the night\nI held on to my faith\nI struggled and I prayed\nAnd now I've finally found my way\n\nIf you believe in yourself enough\nAnd know what you want\nYou're gonna make it happen, make it happen\nYou're gonna make it happen\nAnd if you get down on your knees at night\nAnd pray to the Lord\nHe's gonna make it happen, make it happen\nIf you believe in yourself enough (If you believe)\nAnd know what you want\nYou're gonna make it happen\nAnd if you get down on your knees at night\nAnd pray to the Lord (You just gotta hold on)\nHe's gonna make it happen, make it happen\n\nMake it happen, yeah, make it\nYou're gonna make it, make it, oh, baby\nMake it through the night\nI held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed\nAnd now I've found my way\n\nIf you believe in yourself enough\nAnd know what you want\nYou're gonna make it happen, make it happen\nAnd if you get down on your knees at night\nAnd pray to the Lord\nHe's gonna make it happen, make it happen (Yes, he is)\nIf you believe in yourself enough\nAnd know what you want\nYou're gonna make it happen, make it happen\nAnd if you get down on your knees at night\nAnd pray to the Lord\nHe's gonna make it happen, make it happen\n\nI once was lost, but now I'm found\nI got my feet on solid ground\nThank you, Lord\nIf you believe within your soul\nJust hold on tight and don't let go\nYou can make it, make it happen, yeah\nYou can make it, make it happen\nYou're gonna make it, you're gonna make it\nYou're gonna make it, you're gonna make it\n\nIf you believe in yourself enough (You're gonna make it)\nAnd know what you want\nYou're gonna make it happen, make it happen\nAnd if you get down on your knees at night\nAnd pray to the Lord\nHe's gonna make it happen, make it happen\nIf you believe in yourself enough\nAnd know what you want\nYou're gonna make it happen, make it happen\nAnd if you get down on your knees at night\nAnd pray to the Lord\nHe's gonna make it happen, make it happen",
