 "lyrics": "After the hoping and the praying and the wishing\nGirl, you're all up in my face\nI've never been the one to bite my tongue.  (No, no.)\nI have not one word to say.  (Mmmm.)\nI'm mesmerized by your sexy eyes\nAnd your soft and lovely skin.  (Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm.)\nI want this fiasco to end, so baby, we can start all over again\nListen, I wanna be able\nI wanna be able to love you.  Oh, I\nI wanna be able and let me be the one to please you.  Oh, I\nAs sure as the sun shines all over the earth\nYou're one of God's most precious works\nSee, I'm a man and we make mistakes\nSo please don't take your love away.  Oh, ah\nDon't take your love away.  (Don't take.)\nBaby, don't take your love away, baby\nI need you girl\nDon't take your love away.  (Oh, oh, oh.)\nDon't take your love away\n(Don't take your love away.)\nDon't take you love away from me, my baby\n(Baby, don't take your love away from me.  I need you.)\nDon't take your love away, baby\nMama said \"don't put your hands in the cookie jar.\"\nShe said, \"Son, have control.\"\nShe said \"everything that's sweet ain't good for you, no\n(That's what she said.)\nAnd everything that glitters ain't gold.\"  (Mmmm.)\nAnd now that you're gone\nI realized (Yes I do.) I lost my soul.  (Preach.)\nAnd I don't wanna pass the torch\nBaby, can you give me one more (one more) chance\nI wanna be able, (Mmmm, hmmm.)\nAble to do everything I didin't do before for you, baby\n(I wanna be able.) Listen, I wanna love you, oh, oh, oh, over and over again\nGotta hold myself together and stay strong\nBaby, you've been gone too long\nSee, I'm a man and we make mistakes\nSo baby, baby, baby, don't take your love away\n(Don't take your love away.) I'll get down on my hands and knees\n(Baby, don't take your love away from me.)\nBegging, begging you please,  (I need you, girl.)\n(Don't take your love away.) Don't, don't leave me now\n(Don't take your love away.) I need you right here with me\n(Don't take your love away.) Please, please, please, please, please, yeah\n(Baby, don't take your love away from me.  I need you.)\nDon't take your love away\nSee, girl, I know that I hurt you so (Girl, I know)\nWith all of those girls that were in my world.  (In my world)\nNow Stacy and Kim, damn all of them\nGirl, I wanna give you everything that I can\n(Everything, yeah.) Oh, oh\nI know you're tired of my games, (Of my games)\nTired of my lies.  (Of my lies)\nBaby, this time I promise it'll be alright\n(No, no, no, no, no, no.) No longer will you ever be led astray\nBaby, listen to the words I say\n(Don't take your love away.) Yeah, yeah\n(Baby, don't take your love away from me.)\nYes.  Don't take your love, no.  (I need you, girl.)\n(Don't take your love away.) I've been searching here and there, everywhere\n(Don't take your love away.) And can't find no one like you, girl\n(Don't take your love away.) Don't take your love away\n(Baby, don't take your love away from me.)\nListen to me, lady, lady, lady.  (I need you.)\n(Don't take your love.) Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm",
