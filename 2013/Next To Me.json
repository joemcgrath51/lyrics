 "lyrics": "You won\u2019t find him drinking under tables\nRolling dice or staying out \u2019til three\nYou won\u2019t ever find him be unfaithful\nYou will find him, you\u2019ll find him next to me\nYou won\u2019t find him tryna change the devil\nFor money, fame, for power out of greed\nYou won't ever find him where the rest go\nYou will find him, you\u2019ll find him next to me\n\nNext to me \u2013 wooh hooo\nNext to me \u2013 wooh hooo\nNext to me \u2013 wooh hooo\nYou will find him, you\u2019ll find him next to me\n\nWhen the money\u2019s spent and all my friends have vanished\nAnd I can\u2019t seem to find no help or love for free\nI know that there\u2019s no need for me to panic\n'Cause I\u2019ll find him, I\u2019ll find him next to me\nWhen the skies are grey and all the doors are closing\nAnd the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe\nWhen all I need\u2019s a hand to stop the tears from falling\nI will find him, I\u2019ll find him next to me\n\nNext to me \u2013 wooh hooo\nNext to me \u2013 wooh hooo\nNext to me \u2013 wooh hooo\nI will find him, I\u2019ll find him next to me\n\nWhen the end has come and buildings falling down fast\nWhen we\u2019ve spoilt the land and dried up all the sea\nWhen everyone has lost their heads around us\nYou will find him, you\u2019ll find him next to me\n\nNext to me \u2013 wooh hooo\nNext to me \u2013 wooh hooo\nNext to me \u2013 wooh hooo\nYou will find him, you\u2019ll find him next to me\nNext to me \u2013 wooh hooo\nNext to me \u2013 wooh hooo\nNext to me \u2013 wooh hooo\nYou will find him, you\u2019ll find him next to me",
