 "lyrics": "Treated me kind\nSweet destiny\nCarried me through desperation\nTo the one that was waiting for me\nIt took so long\nStill I believed\nSomehow the one that I needed\nWould find me eventually\n\nI had a vision of love\nAnd it was all that you've given to me\n\nPrayed through the nights\nFelt so alone\nSuffered from alienation\nCarried the weight on my own\nHad to be strong\nSo I believed\nAnd now I know I've succeeded\nIn finding the place I conceived\n\nI had a vision of love\nAnd it was all that you've given to me\nI had a vision of love\nAnd it was all that you've given me\n\nI've realized the dream\nAnd I visualized\nThe love that came to be\nFeel so alive\nI'm so thankful that I've received\nThe answer that heaven has sent down to me\n\nYou treated me kind\nSweet destiny\nAnd I'll be eternally grateful\nHolding you so close to me\nPrayed through the nights\nSo faithfully\nKnowing the one that I needed\nWould find me eventually\n\nI had a vision of love\nAnd it was all that you've given to me\nI had a vision of love\nAnd it was all that you turned out to be",
