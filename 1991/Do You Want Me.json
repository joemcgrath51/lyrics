 "lyrics": "Artist: Salt N Pepa\nAlbum:  Blacks' Magic\nSong:   Do You Want Me\nYou said it loud,\n and I heard you\nNever tried to hurt you\nSome say I'm old-fashioned\nI like to take my time and do it slow\nYou know with the flow\nBut don't try to rush it\nSo ride it like a horse\nAnd let nature take its course\nGet to know each other\nBe my friend not just my lover\nShare your thoughts with me\nLove my mind not just my body, baby\nCHORUS\nDo you really want me, baby?  Let me know\nCuz if you really like me I suggest you tell me so\nGot no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came\nCuz I may be the kind of guy you like\nPlease understand the way I feel\nI must have trust or there's no deal\nMy emotion's ain't to be\nPlayed with or given free\nI appreciate greatly\nThe way you toleratered me\nSometimes I do act flaky\nI wouldn't blame you if you hate me\nYou put up with my butt\nWhen I wouldn't give it up\nYeah, I know that really sucks\nBut if you wait awhile, I'll make it up\nCHORUS\nWho me?  A tease?  Brother, please\nYou're just having bad memories\nAbout some skeeze who did the squeeze\nAnd had you on your hands and knees\nLook, I am telling you straight out\nThat's not what I'm all about\nI'd just be playing myself out\nIf I spent the night at your house\nNow don't get me wrong\nI didn't mean to turn you on\nWe haven't known each other long\nBut this is my life not just a song\nCHORUS",
