 "lyrics": "There's something I know I should have told you\nSomething that's growing everyday\nWhether or not, I say it a lot\nI'm down with you in every single way\nGonna be days when you are lonely\nAnd people will say they got no time (no time)\nWhen you're alone, call me on the phone\nBaby, you always got mine\n\nAnd when the wind blows\nBaby, don't cry, just remember my words\n\nBaby love, gentle as raindrops falling in June\nPretty as sunshine and flowers in bloom\nBaby love, as long as you're happy, I'm happy too\nIt's a delight, you're in my life\n\nBaby love\nBaby love\n\nYou got a glow that just surrounds you\nWhen I'm with you, I'm shining bright\nHoney, it's true, I love the way you do\nAnd I could tell you every night\nYou're so lovely when you're laughing\nIt makes my day to see you smile\nDidn't you know, when you played in the snow\nYou set my winter on fire\n\nAnd when the wind blows\nBaby, don't cry, just remember my worlds\n\nBaby love, gentle as raindrops falling in June\nPretty as sunshine and flowers in bloom\nBaby love, as long as you're happy, I'm happy too\nIt's a delight God gave you life\n\nBaby love\nOoh, baby love\nBaby, baby\n\nBaby love, gentle as raindrops falling in June\nPretty as sunshine and flowers in bloom\nBaby love, as long as you're happy, I'm happy too\nIt's a delight, you're in my life\n\nBaby love",
