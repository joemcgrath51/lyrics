 "lyrics": "Every night a different town, I sing my song\nPlay and sing, pack my things and move along\nA pretty face, another place I never get to know\nA one night stand, another show\nMy guitar, a railroad car, a bus or plane\nChocolate bar and there you are, the price of fame\nIf I could do what I want to, I'd stay and never go\nA one night stand is all I know\nI wish that I could be two people\nInstead of bein' on my own\nI wish that I could be two people\nAnd then I'd never be alone\nPhotographs of where I've been and all I've done\nIn this whole world is there a girl, no, not one\nGoodbye, hello, I've got to go, I hope you'll understand\nA one night man is all I am\nA one night stand, one night man\nGoodbye, hello, I've got to go, I hope you'll understand\nA one night man is all I am\nA one night stand, one night man",
