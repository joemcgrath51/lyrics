(Want you)\nWould you still be calling me? (Still calling you)\nYou be loving me? (I'll be loving you)\nOh, oh, oh, oh\n\nWanna keep you flawed with no dough\nPimpin ain't easy, trust me, I know\nWhen gangstas and hoes\nGo, go, go, go, go, go together\nLike chinchilla and bad weather\nI'm good but been better\nAll my bros, cheddar and glamorous things\nCopped a few cars, a crib with a east and west wing\n'Cause this is how I'm livin' and y'all women know the secrets\nOf how to get it and keep it\nHow to prey on my weakness\n'Cause the power of P-U-S-S-Y\nGot a lotta niggas wonderin', it ain't just I\nGotta keep ya cash comin' and that's on my life\nIf it wasn't for the money and the things I got\nShit, she probably wouldn't like me\nBut I keep her and Irv and Jeffrey quite icy\nSip seraphim, who doesn't like me?\nAnd the murderous I-N-C\n\nIf it wasn't for the money, cars and movie stars and jewels\nAnd all these things I've got\nI wonder, hey\nWould you still want me? (Want you)\nWould you still be calling me? (Still calling you)\nYou be loving me? (I'll be loving you)\nOh, oh, oh, oh\n\nHow many girls does it take to get to\nMack status? Player status?\nPimps that get\nYa boy half rich 'fore we hit show biz\nBut show biz brought next level chicks\nPull up in them hot cars, go and buy the whole bar, nigga\nI came from the dirt, what you want me to say?\nI'm at the top of the world and life's a pussy buffet\nAnd that's why I get M-I-A (Oh)\nShut the game down so the bustas can't play (Oh)\nHell yeah, I splurge money\nHell yeah, I act funny\nLook at you like, \"Fuck you\"\nAll the shit I been through\nIt's a wonder why I'm still here ('Cause)\nSaid I was gone but I'm still here ('Cause)\nAnd all you bitches that left me here (Oh)\nIts mighty strange how you right back here (Oh, oh, oh)\n\nIf it wasn't for the money, cars and movie stars and jewels\nAnd all these things I've got\nI wonder, hey\nWould you still want me? (Want you)\nWould you still be calling me? (Still calling you)\nYou be loving me? (I'll be loving you)\nOh, oh, oh, oh\n\nI wonder why love is about money\nAnd why you wanna take it all from me, honey\nMy life is dark but it's lovely\nCrimes, cars, cribs, ain't that right, Kelly? (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)\nY'all bitches don't know\nMoney ain't a thang\nMami need a lil' change, girl, I'm pitchin' quarters\nClosest to the arches but live in a fortress\nNew Benzes, new Porsches\nNew cases, new lawyers\nI'm becoming the infamous notorious rule\nNiggas couldn't walk a mile in my shoes\nNiggas don't possess the heart that I do\nAnd it's a wonder that I'm still here ('Cause)\nThought I was gone but I'm still here ('Cause)\nAnd all you bitches that left me here (Oh)\nIts kinda funny how you right back there (Oh, oh, oh)\n\nIf it wasn't for the money, cars and movie stars and jewels\nAnd all these things I've got\nI wonder, hey\nWould you still want me? (Want you)\nWould you still be calling me? (Still calling you)\nYou be loving me? (I'll be loving you)\nOh, oh, oh, oh\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh",
