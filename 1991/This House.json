 "lyrics": "Where do we go from here?\nWhat must we do to make that change?\nIt's time to understand\nUnderstand one another\n\nIn a world so cold\nA place of disbelief\nWhere will the people go\nWithout enough to eat?\nLet's not give up hope\nWe have to find a way\nSearch within our soul\nTo make a better day\n\nThis house is our house\nLet's do it for the people\nIt's all in the hands of love\nThis house is their house\nLet's give it back to the people\nThe people of the world today\n\nI see hurt in their eyes\nI hear the sounds of voices cry\nIt's time to open our eyes\nTime to help one another\n\n\n\nYou, me\nWe can make the difference\nAnd you know\nNo one\nNo one likes to be alone, yeah\nWe got to face it heart to heart\nWe have to make a brand new start\nWe got to change the tears to smiles\nWe have to go the extra mile\nIt's time we face reality\nTo give them hope and set them free\nI think it's time we say goodbye\nTo all the homeless people's cry\nWe got to face it heart to heart\nWe have to make a brand new start\nWe got to change the tears to smiles\nWe have to go the exta mile\n(You, me)\nIt's time we face reality\n(We can make the difference)\nGive them hope and set them free\nI think it's time we say goodbye\nTo all the homeless people's cry\n(And you know)\n\nWe've got to take the time\nTo search the mind to find\nThis house, our house\n(It's all in the hands of love)\n(I said it's all in the hands of love)\n\nLet's do it\nLet's do it for the people\nThis house\nLet's give back to the people\nThe people of the world today\nDo it for the people\nThis house\nGive back to the people, yeah\nIt's all in the hands of love",
