 "lyrics": "Lights out, sucker punch, striked out\nCalled it love, we wrote it then I wiped out\nTwo ships just passin' in the night now\nOffshore, lookin' for a lighthouse\n\nGreen pill, you said that it was painless\nDown and out, drownin' in a sea of my anguish\nFunny, you always said hope floats\nComprehended but I can't cope\nSo I...\n\nGotta find my way back, way back\nTo you, baby\nTryin' to find my way back, way back\nTo you, baby\nGotta find my way back, way back\nTo you, to us, to love, love\n\nMan down, my heart's in your hands now\nHid your love, another 'X' in the sand now\nNo clue, no map, damn\nSo I'm diggin' 'til I end up in Japan now\n\nGreen pill, you said that it was painless\nDown and out, drownin' in a sea of my anguish\nFunny, you always said hope floats\nComprehended but I can't cope\nSo I gotta...\n\nGotta find my way back, way back\nTo you, baby\nTryin' to find my way back, way back\nTo you, baby\nGotta find my way back, way back\nTo you, to us, to love, love\n\nWe got lost, lines got crossed\nAnd the light turned to static, babe\nAnd then I jumped ship, got caught up in the current\nAnd it carried both of us away\nWe were so much better\nWhen we were together, baby\nAnd I just can't let you slip away\n\nGotta find my way back, way back\nTo you, baby\nTryin' to find my way back, way back\nTo you, baby\nGotta find my way back, way back\nTo you, to us, to love, love",
