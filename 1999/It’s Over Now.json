 "lyrics": "Baby it's over\n\nTryna forget about ordinary things\nTypical, predictable\nBaby I knew the end before we started\nYou got me feeling like I owe you something\nCause you were there at times when I had nothing\nBut you threw it all away with the shady things you do\n\nBaby please forgive me\nFor what I'm 'bout to say\nAnd what I'm 'bout to do\nI can't take no more\nI know you ain't been true\nAin't got no love for you\nChorus:\nYou been cheating and telling me lies\nYou been creeping while I'm sleeping at night\nAnd you been chasing every girl in sight\nAnd you been messing 'round and now you down\nIt's over now (2x)\n\nI ignore my intuition and pass it off as a suspision\nBut you were just so bold, you kept putting it in my face\nI can't deny I let you hurt me\n\n\n\nWhen you were down I helped to pick you up\n(but you didn't appreciate the love)\nInstead you kept looking for the one\nWhen all the while what you were searching for\nWas in front of your face. Just forget it...\nYou'll regret it...It's really over now\nJust turn around and walk me watch I'm gone",
