 "lyrics": "If I could mail my heart\nRight to you, I would\nI'd pack it up, seal it tight\nAnd I'd send it overnight\n\nEvery time I hear your voice\nAnd I look into your eyes\nSends a burning sweet sensation\nOh, inside of me\nThe look in your eyes has found me\nI am sending\n\nSending my love to you\nPraying that you are home\nSealing it with a kiss\nSending my love\nSending my love to you\nPraying that you are home\nSealing it with a kiss\nSending my love\n\nWith my heart in your hands\nI'm as helpless as a baby\nI'm in desperate need of your love\nSo just send it right away\nI've been thinking bout you, boy\nBecause you're so far way\nMakes me want to send you all this love\nInside of me\nThe look in your eyes has found me\nI am sending\n\nSending my love to you\nPraying that you are home\nSealing it with a kiss\nSending my love\nSending my love to you\nPraying that you are home\nSealing it with a kiss\nSending my love\n\nIf I could mail my heart\nRight to you, I would\nI'd pack it up, seal it tight\nAnd I'd send it overnight",
