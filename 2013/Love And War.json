 "lyrics": "Somebody said every day was gon' be sunny skies\nOnly Marvin Gaye and lingerie\nI guess somebody lied\nWe started discussin', then to fightin', then don't touch me please\nThen it's let's stop the madness, just come lay with me\nAnd truth be told, I'm wavin' my flag before it goes bad, yeah yeah\n\nCause we made it this far on for better or worse\nI wanna feel it even if it hurts\nIf I gotta cry to get to the other side\nLet's go cause we're gon' survive, oh\n\nWe stay on the front lines\nYeah, but we're still here after the bomb drops\nWe go so hard we lose control\nThe fire starts then we explode\nWhen the smoke clears we dry our tears\nOnly in love and war\n\nSometimes you're my general\nYou quarterback all these plays\nSometimes you're my enemy and I'm throwin' grenades\nWe'll just be chillin' and laughin', I'm layin' on your chest\nI don't know what I did cause things just went left\nBut here we go back down that road\nThat's just the way that it goes\n\nCause we made it this far on for better or worse\nI wanna feel it even if it hurts\nIf I gotta cry to get to the other side\nAs long as you're there, I'll survive, oh\n\nWe stay on the front lines\nYeah, but we're still here after the bomb drops\nWe go so hard we lose control\nThe fire starts then we explode\nWhen the smoke clears we dry our tears\nOnly in love and war\n\nAs long as we make up after every fight when it's over\nYou know I'm comin' home, right there, where I belong\nI'm takin' all this over\nOh-oh-oh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh\n\nWe stay on the front lines\nYeah, but we're still here after the bomb drops\nWe go so hard we lose control\nThe fire starts then we explode, baby\nWhen the smoke clears we dry our tears\n\nOnly in love and war\nOnly in love and war\nOnly in love and war",
