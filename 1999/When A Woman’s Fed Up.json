 "lyrics": "I'm standing here looking in the mirror\nSaying \"damn\" to myself\nI should have known the day would come\nThat she would find somebody else\nAnd all the things I took her through\nShit, I shouldn't have lasted this long\nNow I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone\n\n'Cause when a woman's fed up\n(No matter how you beg, no)\nIt ain't nothing you can do about it\n(Nothing you can do about it)\nIt's like running out of love\n(No matter what you say, no)\nAnd then it's too late to talk about it\n(Too late to talk about it)\n\nNow let's talk about how it all goes down\nI used to make love to you daily\nWhen the night fell the same\nAnd anytime that you were hurt\nI could feel your pain\nAnd if I had a dollar\nIt was yours, yeah\nAnd whenever we would go out\nI would front the bill\nBut now the up is down\nAnd the silence is sound\nI hurt you too too many times\nNow I can't come around\n\n'Cause when a woman's fed up\n(No matter how you beg, no)\nIt ain't nothing you can do about it\nNothing you can do about it\nIt's like running out of love\n(No matter what you say, no)\nRunning out of love\nAnd then it's too late to talk about it\n(Too late to talk about it)\nOh yeah, oh yeah\n\nLa da da da da la la da da\nLa da da da da la la da da\nWhoa, listen...\nIf you don't want to find out the hard way\nThen listen to this song while the record plays\n\n'Cause when a woman's fed up\n(No matter how you beg, no)\nMama taught me a long time ago\nIt ain't nothing you can do about it\nNothing you can do about it (Oh no, oh no)\nIt's like running out of love\n(No matter what you say, no)\nAnd then it's too late to talk about it\n(Too late to talk about it)\n (throughout repeating chorus)\n\"You can cry a river\n'Til an ocean starts to form, yeah\nBut she will always remember\n'Cause she's a woman\n \nscorned\nAnd if you ever get her back\nIt will never be the same\nShe's cuttin' the corners of her eyes\nEvery time she see your face\nNow your trust is out the door\nShe don't want you no more\nYou used to tell your boys, not me\nAnd she would always be there for you\nIf you had took the time to see\nWhat that woman meant to you\"\nIs what the mirror said to me\n, whoa\nShe was raised in Illinois\nRight outside of Chicago\nSome of the best cookin' you ever had\nYes, it was and I miss her\nHey woman, if you're listening\nI said I miss you baby",
