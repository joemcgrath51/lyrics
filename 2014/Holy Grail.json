I took her back\nFool me twice, that's my bad\nI can't even blame her for that\nEnough to make me wanna murder\nMomma, please just get my bail\nI know nobody to blame\nKurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh\n\nAnd we all just entertainers\nAnd we're stupid and contagious\nNo, we all just entertainers\n\nAnd, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you\nI just can't crack your code\nOne day, you're screamin' you love me loud\nThe next day, you're so cold\nOne day, you're here, one day, you're there\nOne day, you care, you're so unfair\nSippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over\nHoly Grail\n\nNow I got tattoos on my body\nPsycho bitches in my lobby\nI got haters in the paper\nPhoto shoots with paparazzi\nCan't even take my daughter for a walk\nSee 'em by the corner store\nI feel like I'm cornered off\nEnough is enough, I'm callin' this off\nWho the fuck I'm kiddin' though?\nI'm gettin' high, sittin' low\nSlidin' by in that big body\nCurtains all in my window\nThis fame hurt, but this chain worse\nI think back you asked the same person\nIf this is all you had to deal with\nNigga, deal with, this shit ain't work\nThis light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt\nNiggas dying back where I was birthed\nFuck your iris and the IRS\nGet the hell up off your high horse\nYou got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours\nWhy you mad? Take the good with the bad\nOr throw the baby out with that bath water\n\nYou still alive, still that nigga\nNigga, you survived, you still gettin' bigger\nNigga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa\nIllest nigga alive; Michael Jackson's Thriller\n\nAnd, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you\nI just can't crack your code\nOne day, you're screamin' you love me loud\nThe next day, you're so cold\nOne day, you're here, one day, you're there\nOne day, you care, you're so unfair\nSippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over\nHoly Grail\n\nYou get the air out my lungs whenever you need it\nAnd you take the blade right out my heart\nJust so you can watch me bleed\nAnd I still don't know why\nWhy I love you so much (Thanks for warning me)\nYeah (Thanks for warning me)\nAnd you play this game in spite to drive me insane\nI got it tattooed on my sleeve\nForever in ink with guess whose name?\nBut I still don't know why\nWhy our love is so much (Thanks for warning me)\nYeah (Thanks for warning me)\n\nAnd, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you\nI just can't crack your code\nOne day, you're screamin' you love me loud\nThe next day, you're so cold\nOne day, you're here, one day, you're there\nOne day, you care, you're so unfair\nSippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over\nHoly Grail\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\nDon't know why",
