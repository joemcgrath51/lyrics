 "lyrics": "Ran my Chevy through the car wash\nThrew the beers cans out\nEmptied all the ash trays\nCleaned a little house\nGot my Allman Brothers cassettes\nStacked up on the dash\nGot some jack back in the trunk\nAnd a tank full of gas\nStopped and bought some roses\nTo sweep you off your feet\nYes I'm going for the limit, girl\nI'm gettin' in the real deep\nDusted off my Dingos\nGot my Levis pressed\nGonna break into your heart\nAnd steal what I love best\nYes I'm armed and dangerous\nWoman you've made me a desperate man\nArmed and dangerous\nComin' for your lovin' yes I am\nTake a ride out in the country\nWhere the grass is tall and cool\nAnd do some barefoot dancin'\nHow's that sound to you\nAnd I've got some other things\nThat I might suggest\nBut if I put them on this record\nI'd be under arrest\nYes I'm armed and dangerous\nWoman you've made me a desperate man\nArmed and dangerous\nComin' for your lovin' yes I am\nYes I'm armed and dangerous\nWoman you've made me a desperate man\nArmed and dangerous\nComin' for your lovin' yes I am",
