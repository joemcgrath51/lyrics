 "lyrics": "Ooh, ooh, ooh, girl\nHere's another morning without you\nHere's another day, will I get through\nWithout breaking down\nHaven't seen the sun since you've been gone\nLike my heart I lost it when you left me\nAnd it can't be found\nHow can I go on\nBaby, I've been living on memories\nOf you and me\nAll the love we made\nAll those tender nights\nAnd those endless days, they're all here inside\nBaby, can you stop the rain from falling?\nWon't you chase my clouds away?\nI'd give anything to see the sun again\nOnly you can stop these tears from falling\nI can't face another day, baby, can you stop\nCan you stop the rain? Oh, oh\nEverywhere I go I feel you there\nFollowing my footsteps like a shadow\nOf my broken heart\nSometimes it's a pair of passing eyes\nOr it's just the way someone is talking\nAnd there you are\nAm I all alone\nDon't you ever wake up and reach for me\nWhere I used to be\nIs there any chance\nI just can't believe you're not lonely too\nJust for me and you\nBaby, can you stop the rain from falling?\nWon't you chase my clouds away?\nI'd give anything to see the sun again\nOnly you can stop these tears from falling\nI can't face another day, baby, can you stop\nCan you stop the rain? Oh, oh\nIf you are here for only one night\nBaby, I know you remember\n'Cause loving you once wasn't time enough\nI know we can make it together, together\nBaby, stop the rain\nWon't you chase my clouds away\nI'd give anything to see the sun again\nOnly you can stop these tears of mine from falling\nI can't face another day, baby, can you stop\nCan you, can you stop the rain\nCan you stop the rain? Yeah\nHow can I live without you, baby?\nHow can I let you go? Yeah\nChase my clouds away, yeah",
