I have to go for it\nAnd I like what I see, baby\nAh, come here\n\nI got real bored on a friday night\nI couldn't find a damn thing to do\nSo I pulled out a suit about the same color\nAs my BMW\nI drove to the party and I stepped on in\nJust to see what I could see\nEverybody knew what I was lookin' for\nI was lookin' for some company, that's right\n\nJerk out\nJerkin' everything in sight\nAnd you know that I'm talkin' about the Jerk out\n(I got the cash, I got the ride, Oh Lawd)\nGot to make some love tonight\nAnd you know I got the look\n\nI saw a real fine thing sittin' by the bar\nShe looked kinda all alone\nSo I slid on over and I asked her name\nThe Stella was bad to the bone\nI showed her my stash and I kissed her cheek\nThe only kind of rap it takes\nShe knew I was bad when I jerked her to my ride\nShe said, \"How much money you make?\"\nLet's just say it'll be more money...\n\nJerk out\n(...Than you'll ever see in your lifetime, ha ha)\nJerkin' everything in sight\nI'm talkin' about the Jerk out\nGot to make some love tonight\n\nJerk it, jerk it\nI'm talkin' about the Jerk it, jerk it\nJerk out\nJerk it, jerk it\nI'm talkin' about the Jerk it, jerk it\nJerk out\n\nI took her to my crib and I laid her down\nHer body felt kinda right\nMaybe I was wrong but what the hell\nI figured that was what she liked\nI said \"Baby, don't get too comfortable\n'Cause I really like to sleep alone\nLeave your number on the table by my data bank\nI love you, but you got to go\"\n(What?)\n\nJerk out\n(You ain't got to go home, but you got to get the hell outta here)\nJerkin' everything in sight\nI'm talkin' about the Jerk out\nGot to make some love tonight, all night\nJerk out (What's your number girl?)\nJerkin' everything in sight\nThe master of the Jerk out\nGotta make some love tonight\nAll night\nOh, I got to make some love\n\nJerk it, jerk it\nI'm talkin' about the Jerk it, jerk it\nJerk out\nJerk it, jerk it\nI'm talkin' about the Jerk it, jerk it\nJerk out, Terry\nNasty\nCut 'em, Jessie\n\nJerk out (whoa, that's right)\nJerkin' everything in sight\n(You look so satisfied)\nI'm talkin' about the Jerk out\n(Ha ha ha ha!
