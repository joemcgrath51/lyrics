 "lyrics": "Yeah, wish I told her how I felt\nMaybe she'd be here right now\nBut instead...\n\nI pretended I'm glad you went away\nThese four walls closin' more every day\nAnd I'm dying inside\nAnd nobody knows it but me\nLike a clown I put on a show\nThe pain is real even if nobody knows\nAnd I'm crying inside\nAnd nobody knows it but me\n\nWhy didn't I say\nThe things I needed to say\nHow could I let my angel get away\nNow my world is just a tumblin' down\nI can say it so clearly\nBut you're nowhere around\n\nThe nights are lonely, the days are so sad\nAnd I just keep thinkin' about\nThe love that we had\nAnd I'm missin' you\nAnd nobody knows it but me\n\nI carry a smile when I'm broken in two\nAnd I'm nobody without someone like you\nI'm tremblin' inside\nAnd nobody knows it but me\nI lie awake it's a quarter past three\nI'm screamin' at night as if I thought you'd hear me\nYeah my heart is callin' you\nAnd nobody knows it but me\n\nHow blue can I get\nYou could ask my heart\nBut like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart\nA million words couldn't say just how I feel\nA million years from now you know\nI'll be lovin' you still\n\nThe nights are lonely, the days are so sad\nAnd I just keep thinkin' about\nThe love that we had\nAnd I'm missin' you\nAnd nobody knows it but me\n\nTomorrow mornin' I'm hitting the dusty road\nGonna find you wherever, ever you might go\nI'm gonna unload my heart\nAnd hope you come back to me\nSaid when the nights are lonely...\n\nThe nights are lonely, the days are so sad\nAnd I just keep thinkin' about\nThe love that we had\nAnd I'm missin' you\nAnd nobody knows it but me",
