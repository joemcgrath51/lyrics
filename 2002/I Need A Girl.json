Come on ma\nBeen a whole day now I wanna lay 'round\nAnd sip coladas, dipped in Prada\nI'm smooth as Erik Estrada, dipped in dollars\nWe out in Vegas Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass\n'Bout the size of a campaign ad\nYou don't know how you look to me\nBut if love was a crime you be a crook to me\n'Cause mommy I've done been around the world\nSeened a lot of places\nBeen around your girl believe I read faces\nI can tell she don't want me prevail\nBut I, learn my lesson watchin' Sean stressin'\nSo why listen to her and start guessin'?\nMommy you ain't ready to ride then start dressin'\nI need a girl to receive my mom's blessin'\nConfession, my love no contestin'\nI need affection\nYes I need affection, let's go Mario\n\nGirl what the hell is on your mind?\nI could be dumb but I'm not blind\nThere's something leaking in your mind\nDon't look to good for you and me\nAlways getting weak\nThat ain't what I need, baby!\n\nIs a pretty woman next to me (Oh, please, baby)\nTo share the dreams that I believe (I need a girl in my life)\nMaybe we could start a family (Start a family baby)\nSomeone who truly understands\nHow to treat a man (How to treat a man)\nThis is what I need\n\nAy yo, the sun don't shine forever\nBut as long as were here then we might as well shine together\nNever mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together\nBuild a love that'll last forever\nSo let's stop the pain, stop the rain\nPut stress to rest girl, stop the games\nName the spot, mommy I got the plane\nRoll through rough, I got the Range\nMa I got some thangs, knowned to put rocks in rings\nPushing hundred foot yachts and thangs\nYour man don't play, have you ever been to Saint-Tropez\nOr seen a brotha play a Mandolay?\nGirl I wanna just look in your eyes and watch the sun rise\nNo more lies, no more tears to cry\nNo more reasons for leavin', you I believe in\nLove you till the day I stop breathing\nI love you girl\n\nThis is what I need\nIs a pretty woman next to me\nA pretty woman next to me\nTo share the dreams that I believe\nWhen I wake up in the morning\nMaybe we could start a family\nI wanna see your pretty face\nSomeone who truly understands, how to treat a man\nOh yeah oh yeah\nThis is what I need\nIs a pretty woman next to me\nTo share the dreams that I believe\nSomeone who truly understands, how to treat a man\nThis is what I need baby\nIs a pretty woman next to me\nStanding next to me\nTo share the dreams that I Believe\nWhen I wake up in the morning\nMaybe we could start a family\nI wanna see your pretty face baby\nSomeone who truly understands, how to treat a man\nOh yeah oh yeah\nThis is what I need\nIs a pretty woman next to me",
