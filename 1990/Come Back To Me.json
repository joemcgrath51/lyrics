 "lyrics": "Come...\n\nLooking through my old drawer\nCame across the letter you wrote\nSaid you needed time away\nThat was so long ago\n\nAll my life, I've waited\nTo see your smile again\nIn my mind, I've hated\nNot able to let go\n\nCome back to me\nI'm begging you please\nCome back to me\nHow I want you to\nCome back to me\nI'm begging you please\nCome back to me\n\nLord knows that I have tried\nTo live my life as one\nFriends tell me to hold on\nTough times don't last for long\n\nMy abandoned heart\nJust doesn't understand\nMy undying love for you\nWon't let me wait\n\nCome back to me\nI'm begging you please\nCome back to me\nI want you to\nCome back to me\nI'm begging you please\nCome back to me\nI want you to\nCome back to me\nCome back\nI want you to\nCome back to me\nCome back\n\nPlease come back to me\nI miss you so much\nWherever you are\nI love you\n\nAll my life, I've waited\nTo see your smile again\nIn my mind, I've hated\nNot able to let go\nNot able to let go\nNo, I won't let you go, no\n\nI don't know what else to say\nNo, no, no, no",
