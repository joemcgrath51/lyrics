 "lyrics": "All I hear is raindrops\nFalling on the rooftop\nOh baby tell me why\u2019d you have to go\nCause this pain I feel\nIt won't go away\nAnd today I\u2019m officially missing you\nI thought that from this heartache\nI could escape\nBut I fronted long enough to know\nThere ain\u2019t no way\nAnd today I\u2019m officially missing you\n\nOh can\u2019t nobody do it like you\nSaid every little thing you do\nHey baby say it stays on my mind\nAnd I, I\u2019m officially\n\nAll I do is lay around\nTwo years full of tears\nFrom looking at your face on the wall\nJust a week ago you were my baby\nNow I don\u2019t even know you at all\nI don\u2019t know you at all\nWell I wish that you would call me right now\nSo that I could get through to you somehow\nBut I guess it\u2019s safe to say baby safe to say\nThat I\u2019m officially missing you\n\n\nWell I thought I could just get over you baby\nBut I see that\u2019s something I just can\u2019t do\nFrom the way you would hold me\nTo the sweet things you told me\nI just can\u2019t find a way\nTo let go of you\n\nIt's official\nYou know that I\u2019m missing you\nYeah yes\nAll I hear is raindrops\nAnd I\u2019m officially missing you",
