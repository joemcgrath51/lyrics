 "lyrics": "In the world I'm living\nHell's in front of my eyes\nIgnorance stands to burn the reasons of mankind\nBlack flames of pure insanity\nFrom the sky will come the truth\nA threat reveals to the world\u2026 power in the hands of fools\nScreams of panic in the building on fire\nSlaves of faith against the beast's empire\nAnd the flames consuming higher and higher\u2026\nCritical time in the dawn of a new day\nBound new era by the evil's way\nWhere is peace? It's gone away!\nTowers on fire!\nDiabolical forces ruling\nFrom the acts of human race\nThis kind of situation finishes in disgrace\nBlind by faith and hate\nAn unruly wish to kill\nAcross the times this same shit comes to spill\nHopeless people walking around\nA cloud of dust and terrible sounds\nThe burning tower is falling to the ground\nThe world's watching\u2026 while you die\nDeath embraces you! You can't deny\nI'm not guilty for you folly fight\nTowers on fire!\nInnocent people had paid with their lives\nThey were used in their ominous fight\nFor all that you saw, you can't deny\nAwful thoughts unleashing hate\nLeaving the world at the edge of hell's gate\nThe wheels of doom continue their way\nUnveiling the facts\u2026 prepare to pray\nTime is over and the sky is so grey!\nPage of blood! Terrorism condition\nThe world walks to the last premonition: death!\nRepeat verse #1 and #2\nChorus",
