 "lyrics": "There's far too many of you dying\n\nJune twenty-eight was the date\nThirty-eight to the chest plate\nMommy dear's cryin at the wake\nAnd everybody's dressed up in black suits\nGoin to pay their last respects to the black troop\nWhy'd he have to die is the question that we're under\nBut everyone knows that every day's a different number\nSo when your time comes, just remember, G\nYou'll always have a place in this world as a memory\nEspecially my boys who passed away back in '92\nBest believe that all the boys in the hoods got love for you\nWherever we go, wherever we be, we be thinkin\nOf how we hung in the clubs smokin and drinkin\nNever missin out on a hood fight\nCause everyday back in the hood we had a good fight\nEverything has changed and people are lookin lonely\nIt's gon' be strange spendin New Year's Eve without your homie\nBut ain't much that we can do\nExcept pour brew throughout the crew\nTo make sure we all remember you\nAnd believe me it hurts\nTo see the boy you broke bread with six feet in the dirt... dirt\n\nAnother homie got smoked but it's no surprise\nEverybody's trippin cause the boy was too young to die\nA sad sight to see my homie take his last breath\nEverybody's trippin cause they can't accept my homie's death\nAnother killin was reported on the evenin news\nSomebody's brother got killed behind a pair a shoes\nIn the midst of all this shit I think about myself\nWonderin when somebody's gonna try to take me off the shelf\nBut I refuse to be another violent casualty\nSo when I'm rollin I pack my pistol grip beside my knee\nCause on the city streets today a brother just can't win\nWhen the people you think are your friends really ain't your friends\nUh, and Bushwick can't sleep\nWhen everybody around me keeps fallin \nsix feet deep\n\nThe pain that's deep inside of everybody grows\nAs they approach to see the body before the casket close\nThe person standin next to me has snapped a flick\nOnce I seen the casket closed I knew that that was it\nThe whole entire family spoke on his defense\nThe choir sung the songs that make us reminisce\nAnd durin all the singin I broke down myself\nWhen I looked and seen the family that my partner left\nAnd then the choir broke into its final song\nThinkin to myself the worst is yet to come\nEveryone was headed for the final flight\nAs we creeped along the gravel on the burial site\nThe director said his words and there was not a sound\nAs they lowered my little partner towards inside the ground\nEverybody dropped their flowers on the coffin top\nAnd then they work alone with the concrete block\nAnd that's deep\n\nA lotta homies die, a lotta mothers cry\nI watch tears fall down from their eyes\nEverybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to take the chance\nThey chose the music, so they had to dance\nCouldn't tell him nothin, was a player, had to have it\nGot caught up in the game now my boy's in the casket\nAnd everybody's lookin' for somebody else to blame\nAshamed to let his mother know that he was in the game\nWe used to kick it on the ave at night\nComin up tryin to have the finer things in life\nBut now my boy's gone, I wish he was at home\nI wish he wouldn'ta never fell victim to the chrome\nSo when I drink a brew for you I pour some on the block, son\nYou might be gone but you damn sure ain't forgotten\nSo long, remember whenever or wherever\nDead or alive, real partners come together\nAnd you know that",
