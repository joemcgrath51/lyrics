Well, I don't hear ska on the radio, and do I know why, well, I don't know. But if I get my wish when I get to heaven, I'll hear the ska 24-7. I want ska on the radio! I don't hear it at all! I've got a prime, old-time, familiar dance, gauranteed to shake up your pants. When I turn on the radio, what do I hear? Same old shit, the D.J. chewing my ear. But I still don't hear ska on the radio",
