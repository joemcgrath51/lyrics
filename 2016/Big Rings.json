Oh, we talkin' teams?\nOh, you switchin' sides? Wanna come with me?\nLook at the smile on me, look at the owl on me\nI do not chase girls, but they run a mile for me\nSay she gon' ride for me, I'll buy the tires for you\nThis game is different, you only get one shot when niggas go foul on you\nMan, fuck 'em all, man, we want it all\nDon't get too involved, we gon' knock ya off\nAnd to top it off, I'm with all the dawgs\nIt's a new season and we still breathin'\n\nAnd I got a really big team\nAnd they need some really big rings\nThey need some really nice things\nBetter be comin' with no strings\nBetter be comin' with no strings\nWe need some really nice things\nWe need some really big rings\nI got a really big team\nI got a really big team\nThey need some really big rings\nThey need some really nice things\nBetter be comin' with no strings\nBetter be comin' with no strings\nWe need some really nice things\nWe need some really big rings\nI got a really big team\n\nMan, what a time to be alive\nI'm drinkin' lean, they thought I died\nI run with kidnappers, I'm talkin' 'bout kidnappers\nI'm talkin' 'bout murderin' niggas, I'm talkin' 'bout carjackers\nYou just a battle rapper, I'm an official trapper\nNiggas be droppin' subliminals, nigga, they just some jibber-jabber\nWe take a Mello Yello, then we fill it with red forever-ever\nThese niggas so jealous, jealous\nMan, these niggas get scared, they tellin', tellin'\nI fuck a check up on everything\nI bought some ice when the feds came\nI bought that bitch new Celine, I got rings, I got racks like Serena\nAll of my rings Aquafina, my bitch Aquafina\nPluto and Jupiter, I go to Venus\nI'm fresh out the store, but I'm not out the cleaners\nWho keepin' score? 'Cause these niggas, they losin'\n\n'Cause I got a really big team\nAnd they need some really big rings\nThey need some really nice things\nBetter be comin' with no strings\nBetter be comin' with no strings\nWe need some really nice things\nWe need some really big rings\nI got a really big team\nI got a really big team\nThey need some really big rings\nThey need some really nice things\nBetter be comin' with no strings\nBetter be comin' with no strings\nWe need some really nice things\nWe need some really big rings\nI got a really big team\n\nMan, what a time",
