 "lyrics": "Ayo, you\nYou that just flipped on the CD player\nI just wanna inform you that when you got somebody good\nYou hold on to 'em\nYeah\n\nMust be nice\nHavin' someone who understands the life you live\nMust be nice\nHavin' someone who's slow to take and quick to give\nMust be nice\nHavin' someone who sticks around when the rough times get thick\nSomeone whose smile is bright enough to make the projects feel like a mansion\nMust be nice\nHavin' someone who loves you despite your faults\nMust be nice\nHavin' someone who talks the talk but also walks the walk\nMust be nice\nHavin' someone who understands that a thug has feelings too\nSomeone who loves you for sho'\nYou just remember to never let 'em go\n\n'Cause even when your hustlin' days are gone\nShe'll be by your side still holdin' on\nAnd even when those 20's stop spinnin'\nAnd all those gold-diggin' women disappear\nShe'll still be here\n\nMust be nice\nHavin' someone you can come home to from a long day of work\nMust be nice\nHavin' someone you don't have to show they know exactly where it hurts\nMust be nice\nHavin' someone who trusts you despite what they've heard\nSomeone as mighty as a lion but still as gentle as a bluebird\nMust be nice\nHavin' someone you don't have to tell you don't want to be alone\nMust be nice\nHavin' someone you can grow old with until God calls ya'll home\nMust be nice\nHavin' someone who understands that a thug has feelings too\nSomeone who loves you for sho'\nYou never let 'em go\n\n'Cause even when your hustlin' days are gone\nShe'll be by your side still holdin' on\nAnd even when those 20's stop spinnin'\nAnd all those gold-diggin' women disappear\nShe'll still be here\n'Cause even when your hustlin' days are gone\nShe'll be by your side still holdin' on\nAnd even when those 20's stop spinnin'\nAnd all those gold-diggin' women disappear\nShe'll still be here\n'Cause even when your hustlin' days are gone\nShe'll be by your side still holdin' on\nAnd even when those 20's stop spinnin'\nAnd all those gold-diggin' women disappear\nShe'll still be here\n\nWell I guess the next part of the story is\nThat after all this lusting and all this time I finally found me somebody for me\nSomebody I could tell the way I feel about you",
