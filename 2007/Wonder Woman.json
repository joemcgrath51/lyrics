Baby I wanna play\nWhat you say? Can't let you get away\n'Cause I don't want to leave\nGirl I only wanna be with you with you, with you\n\nI got propers like doctors, I could change your life\nYou should stop watching and jockin' as if you ain't gon' ride\nI wonder something baby we gon' do somethin' tonight\nTonight, oh\n\nThe way you talking girl you seem so invincible\nIt's more than sexy girl, the way that you take control\nI wonder woman are you my kind of woman?\nWith a back like that you fly like jets, are you my wonder woman?\n\nI wonder 'cause I need a special kind of woman be side me\nAre you my wonder woman?
