 "lyrics": "Hey, Jaz, what it sound like?\nSound like something we can work with!\nFull Force, step to 'em!\nAwww, yeah!\n\nBaby, I've been wondering\nWhen will you begin to let me in your heart?\nSo I've been thinking to make the first move\nAnd step to you\nTell you all I feel inside\n(But my heart just falls apart whenever I see you)\nOh, that girl's so untrue\nShe don't appreciate you\n(I would die if I could have a guy like you)\nKick your love to me\nCause I know what to do, baby\n\nBaby, here's my number\nYou can call for free\nIf you want real loving then try me\nI know how to love you\nLook and you will see\nIf you want real loving then try me\n(Try me)\nEx-Girlfriend for you, to sing\n(Just try me, try me)\n\nI know that you want me too\nBut you're scared that\nYou will lose your girl and be alone\n(But don't be a fool)\nCause a heart that breaks\nJust may be your own, so\n(Take a chance and dance with danger)\nBring out the animal in you\nAnd I will tame you\n(See, I wanna be able to train you)\nBring your love to me\n\nAnd I will change your mind and soul\nLeave it up to me to take control\n(Ooh) Give my love a try\n(Ooh) I want 'cha 'til the day I die\n(Ooh) Take you oh so high\nMake you touch the sky\n\nCome on and just try me\nTry me\nYou got a little taste now\nBack to the base\n\n(Try me)\nWhen you're lonely and left all alone\nWhen she don't bother to call you on the telephone\n(Try me)\nWhen she hurts you and never treats you right\n(Try me)\nWhen she slips up... huh, sounds like tonight",
