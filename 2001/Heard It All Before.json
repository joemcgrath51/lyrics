You know what I don't even want to talk to you\nGuy: She don't mean nothing to me!\nGirl: I don't even want to see ya face\nGuy: She was just telling me...\nGirl: I just want to see you walking through that door\nGuy: Baby, don't--\nGirl: There ain't nothing else to say\nGuy: Why we gotta do it like this?\nGirl: Peace!\nGuy: Baby...DAMN!\n\nCome home late it seems you barely beat the sun\nTapping my shoulder thinking you gonna get you some\nSmelling like some fragrance that I don't even wear\nSo If you want some loving I suggest you go back there\nWhere you came from\nDay to day with you it's always something else\nWorking my nerve God knows that I don't deserve\nWhat you put me through cause I been so true to you\nFor you to come at me with another lame excuse\n\nSee I\nHeard it all before\n(Heard it all before)\nAll of ya lies, all of ya sweet talk\nBaby this, baby that\nBut your lies ain't working now\nLook who's hurting now\nSee I had to shut you down\n(I had to shut you down)\nPlayed the fool before\n(Played the fool before)\nI was your fool I believed in you\nYes I did, yes I did\nBut your lies ain't working now\nLook who's hurting now\nSee I had to shut you down\n(I had to shut you down)\n\nWhat were you thinking bringing her into our home\nIn our bed, you must have fell and bumped your head\nMessing up my sheets and violating me\nHave me 'bout to call my peeps and take it to the streets\nNothing you can do and there's nothing you can say\nThat could persuade me to stay with you another day\nYou have crossed the line to the point of no return\nWhat you do from here on out, I am no longer concerned\n\nSee I\nHeard it all before\n(Heard it all before)\n\"Let me explain, baby, it's not what you think\"\nThat's what you said to me\nBut your lies ain't working now\nLook who's hurting now\nSee I had to shut you down\n(I had to shut you down)\nNow I played the fool before\n(Played the fool before)\nYou had a good game, I must admit\nI was it (I was it), but now it's over\nBut your lies ain't working now\nLook who's hurting now\nSee I had to shut you down\n(I had to shut you down)\n\nI used to hang on to your every word (every word)\nBut the more you lie to me the more I hurt (mmm)\nThe things you use to say would sound so sweet\n(Sound so sweet)\nI was naive quick to believe\n\nI heard it all before\n\"I was at work, it wasn't my car you saw\nBaby, I swear it wasn't me!\"\nBut your lies ain't working now\nLook who's hurting now\nSee I had to shut you down\n(I had to shut you down)\nPlayed the fool before\n(Played the fool before)\nYou were my boo, I trusted you\nFor way too long (Way too long)\nBut your lies ain't working now\nLook who's hurting now\nSee I had to shut you down\n(I had to shut you down)\nHeard it all before\nYou know you messed up\nYou got to know you messed up\nYou got to go now\nSay what you want (Say what you want)\nBut your lies ain't working now\nLook who's hurting now\nSee I had to shut you down\n(I had to shut you down)\nPlayed the fool before (Played the fool)\nI done change the locks on the door (Yes I did)\nAnd you ain't welcome no more\nBut your lies ain't working now\nLook who's hurting now\nLook who's hurting now, now, now, now\nSee I had to shut you down\n(I had to shut you down)\n\nSee I heard it all before",
