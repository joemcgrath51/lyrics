I'm sick like see I heard your girl had fucked with me that's so tragic\nI'm the cream of the crop and I'm the cash cow\nEveryone coming around me with their hands out\nReally used to fight me keep on saying I'm the man now\nFunny how it changed when they heard I'm making bands wow\nPockets be on Timmy Thick, ask your trick daddy\nActing like I'm Slick Rick, bitch get the (?) now\nI been racing, I been running ever since I hit the ground\nAt the age of 6 I flipped the brick and I was trapping out the house\nI meet the same girls just in different bodies\nThey be acting out of pocket, trying to get into my pockets\nThey swagger they be jocking, all you niggas need to stop it\nThey just buying what I'm copping and they don't think that I'm watching\nAnd I'm almost out of options so be careful how you talking\nCause you know just how I'm rocking, scrrt scrrt scrrt inside a rocket\nAnd I shoot don't catch me boxing, Micheal Vik'ing all these niggas\nImma stomp on all you Thompsons\nAye, aye, aye, aye\n\nDon't have to be a miner to know that she gold digging\nCause she sees you rolling in it with them doors tinted\nThat's why like my momma I been thinking so cynic-al\nCause hoes is gon' take your life in 3 minutes\nShe looking like a million, she ain't worth a million\nYou better wrap it up before you need a clinic\n\"Well man just pull out,\" homie ain't that fucking brilliant\nGo ahead and try that and I'll see you at your next appointment\nAnd you're popping at the moment like you need some ointment\nBut you better know that all these hoes want is your arcade tokens\nAnd they think you're fly just like a swarm of fucking locusts\nSo when they bust it open, boy you better notice\nWhen theym\n\nLook Back at it\nDrop it real, real low and look back at it, uh\nLook back at it\nYou see the money in my pockets looking back at it, so please\nLook back at it\nDrop it real, real low and look back at it, yeah\nLook back at it\nThrow it back and act like that to stay up in my crib another minute\n\nNot only girls but homies too they'll take your bread at night\nGotta take it slow cause my blood thicker than some cellulite\nAnd the circle tighter than a little bitty head at night\nImma pull her hair not cause it's hot but do it out of spite\nMy flow refreshing kick back with a can of sprite\nImma take it back like throwback shows that's up on Nick at Night\nListen to them both you'll feel just like it's 1999\nIn between them shows you'll see the hoes that's on them paid hotlines\nBack to the topic, I almost forgot it Imma\nTell these dick riding ass dudes take a step back cause they won't\nGet a dime up out my life and they best fucking learn it\nIf you want a slice of pie you gotta fucking earn it\nSo ladies\n\nLook Back at it\nDrop it real, real low and look back at it, uh\nLook back at it\nYou see the money in my pockets looking back at it, so please\nLook back at it\nDrop it real, real low and look back at it, yeah\nLook back at it\nThrow it back and act like that to stay up in my crib another minute",
