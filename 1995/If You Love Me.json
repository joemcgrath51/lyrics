 "lyrics": "I don't wanna rain on this parade\nBut I'm starting to question the love that was made\nI'm not looking for just an affair\nWant a love that is based on truth, not just dare\n\nYou will not hurt my pride\nIf right now you decide\nThat you are not ready to settle down\nBut if you want my heart\nThen it's time that you start\nTo act like you're mine, in the light and the dark\n\nIf you love me, say it\nIf you trust me, do it\nIf you want me, show it\nIf you need me, prove it\nIf you love me, say it\nIf you trust me, do it\nIf you want me, show it\nIf you need me, prove it\n\nYou see now actions speak louder than words\nSo don't just say things that I've already heard\nDon't want your body without your soul\nI don't want a love who will come here and go\n\nYou will not hurt my pride\nIf right now you decide\nThat you are not ready to settle down\nBut if you want my heart\nThen it's time that you start\nTo act like you're mine, in the light and the dark\n\nIf you love me, say it\nIf you trust me, do it\nIf you want me, show it\nIf you need me, prove it\nIf you love me, say it\nIf you trust me, do it\nIf you want me, show it\nProve it\nIf you love me, say it\nIf you trust me, do it\nShow it\nProve it\nSay it\nDo it\nShow it\nProve it\n\nOh I, Oh I, I wanna touch you baby\nAnd spread my love, all around you honey\nAnd if you care, you gotta show it baby\nTrue love to share\nShow it\nProve it\n\nSay it\nDo it\nShow it\nProve it\nSay it\nDo it\nShow it\nProve it\nSay it\nDo it\nShow it\nProve it\nSay it\nDo it\nShow it\nProve it\nSay it\nDo it\nShow it\nProve it",
