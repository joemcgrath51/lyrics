What you're feelin' I am feelin' too?\nNever stop never giving up\nNever stop never giving up\nNever stop never giving up\nNever stop never giving up\nEvergreen, growin' up but fadin' never\nThis is what our love became, free at last\nFree from all the pain and sorrow\nNever feel the hurt again\nTrue, there ain't a minute in the the day that's without you\nHoping that you feel it too\nWhat you want? What you're feelin' I am feelin' too?\nNever stop never giving up\nTrue, there ain't a minute in the the day that's without you\nHoping that you feel it too\nWhat you want? What you're feelin' I am feelin' too?\nNever stop never giving up\nTake your time won't you try love\nNot a thing you can buy love\nTake your time won't you try love\nNot a thing you can buy love\nNever stop never giving up\nTrue, there ain't a minute in the the day that's without you\nAnd I'm hoping that you feel it too\nWhat you want? What you're feelin' I am feelin' too?\nNever stop never giving up\nOh true baby baby\nNever never stop, you never never never never never come\nNever stop, never stop",
