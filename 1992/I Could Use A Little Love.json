 "lyrics": "Five minutes to midnight and the mood is right\nA lot of wine, a 'lil music, slow dancing by candlelight\nCan't you feel it inside you there's something going on\nIt's too strong to be questioned and it feels too good to be wrong\nWhenever we touch like this\nWhenever I kiss you lips\nBaby my heart beats faster by the minute\nWhenever I touch your face, you know I want you right here\nI want you right now cause there's so much pleasure in your embrace\nDarlin' I, I could use a 'lil love right now\nDarlin' I, I could use a 'lil love right now\nBaby let's take a shower and let the water run\nWe could stay in there for hours, cause you know that it could be fun\nJust put your head on my pillow cause I wanna rub your back\nOoh the way you get emotional girl I know you like it like that\nDarlin' I, I could use a 'lil love right now\nDarlin' I, I could use a 'lil love right now\nDo it in the bath do it in the tub\nDo it in the living room on the rug\nDo it in the kitchen do it in the sink\nDo it whichever way you think\nDarlin I, I could use a 'lil love right now\nI'll be tender baby, I swear I'll do all I can\nAll I can to satisfy you\nYou're complete surrender is all I got\nSo let's take it to the limit, play by the rules\nGo for broke, do whatever we choose",
