 "lyrics": "I heard the phone ring it's you\nTellin' me all I do is neglect you\nThe first thing that I wanna say\nYou know I've been working hard all day, baby\nI don't trip on what your friends say\nCause you know they all want me anyway\nYou know that I'll be true to you\nMy love can't start until\n\nAfter 12, before 6\nI want you all up in my mix\nI wanna make love to you\nAll night long\nAfter 12, before 6\nI want you all up in my mix\nI wanna make love to you\nAll night long\n\nAnd now that 12 o'clock is here\nI wanna please you and I'm being sincere\nThe rest of the night is yours and mine\nWe're gonna chill, relax and unwind baby\nI go to work tired each and every day\n'Cause I spent the night before pleasing my babe\nYou know that I am true to you\nBut love can't start until\n\nAfter 12, before 6\nI want you all up in my mix\nI wanna make love to you\nAll night long\nAfter 12, before 6\nI want you all up in my mix\nI wanna make love to you\nAll night long\n\nYou, you will never be alone\n'Cause I know just how to keep my baby satisfied\n\nAfter 12, before 6\nI want you all up in my mix\nI wanna make love to you\nAll night long\nAfter 12, before 6\nI want you all up in my mix\nI wanna make love to you\nAll night long",
