Ooooooooo....\n\nPray God you can cope\nI'll stand outside\nThis woman's work\nThis woman's world\nOoooh it's hard on a man\nNow his part is over\nNow starts the craft of the Father\n\nI know you've got a little life in you left\nI know you've got a lot of strength left\nI know you've got a little life in you yet\nI know you've got a lot of strength left\n\nI should be crying but I just can't let it show\nI should be hoping but I can't stop thinking\nAll the things we should've said that I never said\nAll the things we should have done that we never did\nAll the things we should have given but I didn't\nOh darling make it go\nMake it go away\n\nGive me these moments\nGive them back to me\nGive me that little kiss\nGive me your talking hands\n\n(I know you have a little life in you yet)\nGive me your hand baby\n(I know you have a lot of strength left)\nGive me your pretty hand\n(I know you have a little life in you yet)\nOoooh oooh oooh\n(I know you have a lot of strength left)\nYou're loved child\n(I know you have a little life in you yet)\nWhatever you need baby\n(I know you have a lot of strength left)\nGive me your hand\n(I know you have a little life in you yet)\nGive me your hand\n(I know you have a lot of strength left)\n\nOh I should be crying but I just can't let it go\nI should be hoping but I can't stop\nThinking and thinking and thinking\nOf all the things we should've said that we never said\nAnd all the things we should have done that we never did\nAll the things that you wanted from me\nAll the things that you needed from me\nAll the things I should have given but I didn't\nOh darling make it go\nJust make it go away",
