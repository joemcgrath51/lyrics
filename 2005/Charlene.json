 "lyrics": "Woke up this morning found a letter that she wrote\nShe said she's tired that I'm always on the road\nToo hard to swallow being alone\nShe needs someone at night that she can hold\nShe must have told me a thousand times before\nSilent cries I use to ignore\nGod knows I love her\nDidn't mean to hurt her\n\nBaby I'll be\nSitting here waiting on you to come home again\nI won't leave\nPromise I'll be here to the very end\nBy your side\nTo protect you and to love you and to be with you for life\nCome on home to me Charlene\n\nShe knows I really love this old music thing\nSince I was a child it's been my dream\nI can support her treat her and spoil her\nYou know buy her the finer things\nBut I forgot about loving her\nDamn the money, diamonds, and pearls\nWhat about the hard day she had with the baby\nAll she need is for me to love her\n\nBaby I'll be\nSitting here waiting on you to come home again\nI won't leave\nPromise I'll be here to the very end\nBy your side\nTo protect you and to love you and to be with you for life\nCome on home to me Charlene\n\nPromise I can't live without her\nGod knows I need her loving\nAnd it hurts so bad that's she gone away\nI pray that she'll come back one day\nIn my life\n\nBaby I'll be\nSitting here waiting on you to come home again\nI won't leave\nPromise I'll be here to the very end\nBy your side\nTo protect you and to love you and to be with you for life\nCome on home to me Charlene\n\nOh oh oh\nSometimes I cry\nCharlene if you're listening would you call on me\nBecause my heart is aching",
