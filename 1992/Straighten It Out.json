Smooth\nAnd we're here to tell you to...\nAnd that's a fact, baby\nNow you're gonna kick some lyrics\nLike this, c'mon...\n\nWalk the fine chalk line, and put the needle to the grind\nRepresentin' one kind, seeing eye for the blind\nWitness what I carry on bears a further purpose\nFrom how we do slam a few, then you want to purchase\nA dialogue of funk, you love to pop it in your trunk\nI win, more disciplined than a Shaolin monk\nPete Rock and C.L., well set to spark it\nThe powerful target to destroy the black market\nBut when you say black, listen, I don't know, you lose me\nI guess another beggar can't afford to be choosey\nI come to the maximum, artist on a major label\nAny duplication of this one is fatal\nOn one two five, I gotta hit ya live\nBeat your ass with my tape, any race or shape\nCuz if they got mine, they got yours too\nBut together here's what we gotta do\n\nTell 'em... straighten it out\nAh, yeah... straighten it out\nYou know this is the word (say what?)... straighten it out\nThat's right y'all... straighten it out (say what?)\nYou got to... straighten it out\nEverybody must... straighten it out (say what?)\nStraighten it out... yeah\nStraighten it out... it's like that (say what?)\n\nThe funk legacy I pass on, clearancy for high rates\nEvery time we sample all the past time greats\nStick it in the SP-1200 beat, I make a loop\nLovely, way to troop in a Lexus coupe\nJust a little bit, set to make a whole lot happen\nThe musical inside my rappin'\nWritten by the C.L., produced by the P.R\nAnd add in any credit that you heard thus far\nI start from scratch, cuz the bassline's critical\nBetter than the original who first made it\nNow you want to sue me, but fans never boo me\nBelieve I know the times, we been broke, too, G\nHere's another sample clear, see ya, get the hell outta here\nLike a bootleg, you're over for the year\nYou'll only get the credit where the credit is due\nSo, listen, what I shout out is true\n\nYeah, true... straighten it out\nYou gots to tell 'em to... straighten it out\n(Say what?)... straighten it out\nYou got to tell 'em to... straighten it out\n(Say what?)... straighten it out\nThat's right... straighten it out\nC'mon (say what?)... straighten it out\nThat's right... straighten it out\nStraighten it out (say what?)\n\nLike the strands of lamb's wool, I'm thinkin' that's said\nHere to go to the head and count the locks on a dred\nI and I'd 'mit to verify, goin' to multiply\nA theory many thought a conspiracy\nHere to let you know that it applies to all of us\nYou're no exceptions to the rule and that's a plus\nCause who Jah bless, let no one curse\nStraighten out what I be about, reckon above the clout\nAnd let the management work for me\nBecause I don't need the unnecessary hostility\nA proper marketing plan so we can gobble up the dough\nStraighten it out, so everybody know\nThe kids are official with the purpose of a smooth surface\nKickin' the service one time to make 'em nervous\nWe're finally here and very long overdue\nPete Rock, this one's for the crew\n\nYou gotta... straighten it out\nEverybody must... straighten it out (say what?)\nYou gotta... straighten it out\nEverybody must... straighten it out (say what?)\nStraighten it out... you got to\nStraighten it out... c'mon (say what?)\nStraighten it out\nAll black people must... straighten it out\nSay what?\n\nStraighten it out\nEverybody must... straighten it out\nThe YG's, they must... straighten it out\nThe Hilltop, they must...straighten it out\nThe whole money-earnin' must... straighten it out\nEverybody must... straighten it out\nCome on... straighten it out\nAh, yeah... straighten it out (to close)",
