(ooh)\nBaby boy, make me lose my breath (my breath)\nBring the noise, make me lose my breath\nHit me hard, make me lose my 'huh, huh' (ha ha)\nCan you keep up?\nBaby boy, make me lose my breath\nBring the noise, make me lose my breath\nHit me hard, make me lose my breath ('huh, huh') (ooh-ooh)\n\nCan you keep up? (ooh)\nBaby boy, make me lose my breath\nBring the noise, make me lose my breath (my breath)\nHit me hard, make me lose my 'huh, huh' (ha ha)\nCan you keep up? (can you keep up, yeah?)\nBaby boy, make me lose my breath\nBring the noise, make me lose my breath\nHit me hard, make me lose my breath ('huh, huh') (ooh)\n\nIf you can't make me say *ooh*\nLike the beat of this *drum*\nWhy you asked for something?\nYou ain't really want *not'in'*\nIf you can't make me say 'ooh'\nLike the beat of this groove\nYou don't have no business in this\nHere's your papers, baby\nYou are dismissed...\n\nCome on\nBreathe wit' me\n'Huh, huh'\nDarkchild\nCome on, let's go\n\nCan you keep up?\nBaby boy, make me lose my breath\nBring the noise, make me lose my breath\nHit me hard, make me lose my 'huh, huh'\nCan you keep up?\nBaby boy, make me lose my breath\nBring the noise, make me lose my breath\nHit me hard, make me lose my breath ('huh, huh')\n\nCan you keep up?\nBaby boy, make me lose my breath\nBring the noise, make me lose my breath\nHit me hard, make me lose my 'huh, huh'\nCan you keep up?\nBaby boy, make me lose my breath\nBring the noise, make me lose my breath\nHit me hard, make me lose my breath ('huh, huh')",
