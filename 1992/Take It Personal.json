 "lyrics": "Take it personal\nTake it personal\nTake it personal\n\nI never thought that you would crab me\nUndermine me, and backstab me\nBut I can see clearly now the rain is gone\nThe pain is gone but what you did was still wrong\nThere was a few times I needed your support\nBut you tried to play me like an indoor sport\nLike racquetball, tennis, pool, whatever\nAll I know is that you attempted to be clever\nNevertheless, cleverness can't impress\n'Cause now you've been exposed like a person undressed\nAnd I could see through you, 'cause I'm the Guru\nAnd what you gonna do when I start to step to you?\n'Cause when I pay you back, I'll be hurting you\nAnd this ain't no threat so take it personal\n\nTake it personal\nTake it personal\nTake it personal\n\nRap is an art, you can't own no loops\nIt's how you hook 'em up and the rhyme style, troop\nSo don't even think you could say someone bit\nOff of your weak beat, come on, you need to quit\nI flip lines and rhymes that never sound like yours\nThere ought to be laws against you yapping your jaws\nOriginality overflows in me\nAnd the truth is, that you wish you could live the\nLife I live and kick the lyrics I kick\nBut bear in mind that you can't think this quick\nSo Premier drops beats for me to say verses to\nAnd if I sound doper, then take it personal\n\nTake it personal\nTake it personal\nTake it personal\nTake it personal\nTake it personal\nTake it personal\n\nDon't be mad 'cause I don't come around the way\nLike I used to, I don't have time these days\nI'm keeping busy making power moves\nAnd don't try to say I don't remember you\nYou shouldn't let your jealousy show like that\nI stopped coming by 'cause of the way you act\nTelling my business to kids I don't even know\nYou're like a daytime talk show, and that's low\nSo you can tell everyone, that I'm jerking you\nAnd if you don't like it, kid, take it personal\n\nTake it personal\nTake it personal\nTake it personal\nTake it personal",
