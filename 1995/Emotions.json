Soooo In Love Yeah\n(So You May Go Thru Emotions Some Times, And Even Have Some Ups In Downs, But I Know One Thing For Sure Your Gonne Fall In Love)\n Make You Fall In Love...\nUhhh Come On Baby, Uhh Come On Suga\nEmotions Make You Fall...\nAhh Suga Baby, Oh Baby, I Tell You, I Tell, Its All About Emotions, All About Emotions\n\nCome On Baby Come On Sugar, Say, Alright\nAlright Alright Alright\nSay Alright Alright Alright Alright\nI Know Its Alright Yeah Said The Make You Fall In Love...",
