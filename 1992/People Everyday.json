 "lyrics": "See I was restin' at the park mindin' my own\nBusiness as I kick up the treble tone\nOn my radio tape player box, right\nJust loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?\nOutta nowhere comes the woman I'm datin'\nInvestigation maybe she was demonstratin'\nBut nevertheless I was pleased\nMy day was goin' great and my soul was at ease\nUntil a group of brothers started buggin' out\nDrinkin' the 40 oz, goin' the nigga route\nDisrespectin' my black queen\nHoldin' their crotches and bein' obscene\nAt first I ignored them 'cause see I know their type\nThey got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight\nAnd they see a young couple having a time that's good\nAnd their egos wanna test a brother's manhood\nSo they came to test Speech 'cause of my hair-do\nAnd the loud bright colors that I wear (boom!)\nI was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit\nAnd the outfit that I'm wearin' brothers dissin' it\nWell I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be\nBut they're squeezin' parts of my date's anatomy\nWhy, Lord, do brothers have to drill me?\n'Cause if I start to hit this man he'll have to kill me, see\n\nI am everyday people\nYou see, I am everyday people\n\nI told the niggas please let us pass, friend\nI said please 'cause I don't like killin' Africans\nBut he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube\nBut I had to take the brother out for being rude\nAnd like I said before I was mad by then\nIt took three or four cops to pull me off of him\nBut that's the story y'all of a black man\nActin' like a nigga and get stomped by an African\nYou see\n\nI am everyday people\nYou see, I am everyday people\n\nThe moral of the story is\nYou better look very hard at who you're steppin' to\n'Cause you might get killed or shot and it's not worth it\nAfricans need to be lovin' each other and unite",
