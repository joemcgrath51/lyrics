'Cause we do not listen to rats\nWe in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best\nPoint at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net\nI'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched\nOoh-oh\nBring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs\nEven though I got a case, I'ma do what it take\nAnd I never been embraced\nAnd the money's hard to make\nSo I bet they on they face right now\n\nI know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad\nWhat they had didn't last, damn, baby\n\nSometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby\nI took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby\nWe took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby\nWhere do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?\n\nWhen he tell the story, that's not how it went\nKnow they be lyin', a hundred percent\nMoved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'\nValet just called me to tell me come get it\nKnocked that boy off and I don't want no credit\nIf it was me, they wouldn't regret it\nLeft me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah\nHeart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'\nBackyard, it look like the Garden of Eden\nPillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea\nAnd then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it\nIt's hard to believe it\n\nI know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad\nWhat they had didn't last, damn, baby\n\nSometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby\nI took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby\nWe took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby\nWhere do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?",
