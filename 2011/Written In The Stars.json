 "lyrics": "Oh, written in the stars\nA million miles away\n, a message to the main, oh\nSeasons come and go, but I will never change\nAnd I\u2019m on my way\n(Let's go!)\n\nYeah, you\u2019re listening now\nThey say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while\nThat's why they play my song on so many different dials\nCause I got more fuckin' hits than a disciplined child\nSo when they see me everybody brrrap, brrraps\nMan I\u2019m like a young gun fully black Barack\nI cried teardrops over the Massive Attack\nI only make hits like I work with a racquet and bat\nLook at my jacket and hat, so damn berserk\nSo down to earth, I\u2019m bringing gravity back\nAdopted by the major\n, I want my family back\nPeople work hard just to get all their salary taxed\nLook, I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman\n(Where the hell's all the sanity at?) Damn\nI used to be the kid that no one cared about\nThat's why you have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out\n\nOh, written in the stars\nA million miles away\n, a message to the main, oh\nSeasons come and go, but I will never change\nAnd I\u2019m on my way\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh \n(oh)\nOh, oh, oh, oh  \n(oh)\nOh, oh, oh, oh  \n(oh)\nOh, oh, oh, oh  \n(oh)\n\nYeah, I needed a change, when we ate, we never tipped\nBecause we needed the change, I needed a break\nFor a sec, I even gave up believing and praying\nI even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray\nThey say that money is the root to the evilist ways\nBut have you ever been so hungry, it keeps you awake?\nMate, now my hunger would leave them amazed, great\nIt feels like a long time coming, fam\nSince the day I thought of that cunning plan\nOne day I had a dream, I tried to chase it\nBut I wasn\u2019t going nowhere, \nrunning man\nI knew that maybe someday I would understand\nTryna change a tenner to a hundred grand\nEveryone's a kid that no one cares about\nYou just gotta keep screaming until they hear you out\n\nOh, written in the stars\nA million miles away\n, a message to the main, oh\nSeasons come and go, but I will never change\nAnd I\u2019m on my way\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh \n(oh)\nOh, oh, oh, oh  \n(oh)\nOh, oh, oh, oh  \n(oh)\nOh, oh, oh, oh  \n(oh)\nOh, oh, oh, oh \n(iSHI)\nOh, oh, oh, oh  \n(Eric Turner)\nOh, oh, oh, oh  \n(Let's go)\n\nOh, seasons come and go, but I will never change\nAnd I\u2019m on my way",
