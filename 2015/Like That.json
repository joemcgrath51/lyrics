You hot as a flame!\"\nYour momma's the only one that you can blame\"\nYou so cute, girl, yeah you is a blessing\nAnd I'm the reason that your boyfriend keep flexing\nNever stop texting every time\u200b I see your name up in my phone\nI'm just picturing your body in that dress and makeup on\nYou don't even need the makeup\nSave that shit for later\nYou the baddest thing I seen I'm thanking your creator\nGirl, I see you working like Miley Cyrus be twerking\nI'm certain you'll be screaming for me when I close the curtains\nBut it's funny, 'cause I'm the one screaming out for ya, baby\nI've been messin' around with too many girls I need a lady\nHoping you could be the one, but you need to show it\nAnd if you prove it to me, all this money, girl we'll blow it\n\nI ain't never met a girl, like you\nAnd you'll never find a man like me\nWalking out the door with you on my arm\nYou can hit me on my phone anytime you want\nGot me goin' mad when you dress like that\nGirl, it's a trap when you act like that\nI ain't even mad when you dress like that\nI know you know you bad (Ok) when you act like that (Hah) (Get it)\n\nWalked up in the spot we do this a lot\nLivin' at the top, attention you caught mine\nLet's pop a bottle, good God, look at what we got\nDouble take like a stop sign\nI thought I would be done with all of this stuff\nBut shit, I guess not\nI'm tryin' to get at you\nTrust me I'm not your average individual\nYeah, I can slow it down\nAnd I ain't talking 'bout verse\nI know what you're worth\nIn my head I've already bought you a purse, and much more\nAnd I got everything you need, just like the drugstore\nOh, and before you ask\nKeep the haters off of my nuts, yeah that's what the cuffs for\nA bunch more\nChances are coming your way but I know that you'll take me\n(It's crazy)\nHow people get lust and love mixed up I'm beginnin' to daydream\nOf what we could be and the things we could do if you give me your time\nBut tonight, all that's on my mind is gettin to know you and making you mine\nYou're a dime\nGirl\nA straight ten\nLike holy moly, me oh my\nI don't even know where to begin\nAnd let's pretend that in this moment in time, we're more than friends\nAnd I recommend that you and I get familiar\n\nI ain't never met a girl like you\nAnd you'll never find a man, like me\nWalking out the door with you on my arm\nYou can hit me on my phone anytime you want\nGot me goin' mad when you dress like that\nGirl, it's a trap, when you act like that\nI ain't even mad when you dress like that\nI know you know you bad when you act like that\nOh yeah",
