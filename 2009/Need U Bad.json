(Baby, I want you bad.)\nI need you bad I can't take this pain.  (Bad I can't take this pain)\nBoy, I'm about to go insane.  (Baby, I need you bad.)\nI need you, I need you\nWhat I gotta do.  (Baby, I want you bad.)\nI need you, I need you\nDo it all for you.  (Baby, I need you bad.)\nBaby, there's nothing I wouldn't do\nTo get back what we had when love was true\n(Oh, oh, oh)\nNo lie I'd give up all I got\nJust so I could get back in my spot\nOhhh, oh, oh, oh\nBoy, I need you bad as my heartbeat\nBad like the food I eat\nBad like the air I breathe.  (Baby, I want you bad.)\nI need you bad I can't take this pain.  (Bad I can't take this pain)\nBoy, I'm about to go insane.  (Baby, I need you bad.)\nI need you, I need you\nWhat I gotta do.  (Baby, I want you bad.)\nI need you, I need you\nDo it all for you.  (Baby, I need you bad.)\nAhhh, let's go!\nWhen you want him so bad and you gotta get him back\nSay oh, oh, oh, oh.  (Oh, oh, oh, oh)\n'Cause it won't get no better till you are together\nSay oh, oh, oh, oh.  (Oh, oh, oh, oh)\nIf you believe in love and you can't give him up\nSay oh, oh, oh, oh.  (Oh, oh, oh, oh)\nIf there's nothing you won't do to get back with your boo\nSay oh, oh, oh, oh\nBoy, I need you bad as my heartbeat\nBad like the food I eat\nBad as the air I breathe.  (Baby, I want you bad.)\nI need you bad I can't take this pain.  (Bad I can't take this pain)\nBoy, I'm about to go insane.  (Baby, I need you bad.)\nI need you, I need you\nWhat I gotta do.  (Baby, I want you bad.)\nI need you, I need you\nDo it all for you.  (Baby, I need you bad.)\nMe ah do dis for you baby\nMe ah stand here wit my heart inna me hand\nYuh no see me?\nMe can't tink, me can't eat, me can't breathe\nWahamum to you?\nWhy you ah make me go through dem summhin, yah?\nCome back to me, baby\nYeah, I'm-a do anything for you, you hear?\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.)\nCulo!",
