 "lyrics": "It\u2019s been awhile, I\u2019m not who I was before\nYou look surprised, your words don\u2019t burn me anymore\nBeen meaning to tell you, but I guess it\u2019s clear to see\nDon\u2019t be mad, it\u2019s just a brand new kind of me\nCan't be bad, I found a brand new kind of free\n\nCareful with your ego, he\u2019s the one that we should blame\nHad to grab my heart back, God knew something had to change\nI thought that you\u2019d be happy\nI found the one thing I need\nWhy you mad? It\u2019s just the brand new kind of me\n\nIt took a long, long time to get here\nIt took a brave, brave girl to try\nIt took one too many excuses, one too many lies\nDon't be surprised, don't be surprised\n\nIf I talk a little louder, if I speak up when you're wrong\nIf I walk a little taller, I been under you too long\nIf you notice that I'm different, don't take it personally\nDon't be mad, it's just a brand new kind of me\nAnd it ain't bad, I found a brand new kind of free\n\nIt took a long, long road to get here\nIt took a brave, brave girl to try\nI've taken one too many excuses, one too many lies\nDon't be surprised, see you look surprised\n\nIf you were a friend, you wanna get to know me again\nIf your were worth a while, you'd be happy to see me smile\nI'm not expecting sorry, I'm too busy finding myself\nI've got this, I've found me, I've found me\n\nI don\u2019t need your opinion, I\u2019m not waiting for your okay\nI\u2019ll never be perfect, but at least now I\u2019m brave\nNow my heart is open, and I can finally breathe\nDon\u2019t be mad, it\u2019s just a brand new kind of free\nThat ain't bad, I found a brand new kind of me\nDon't be mad, it's just a brand new time for me",
