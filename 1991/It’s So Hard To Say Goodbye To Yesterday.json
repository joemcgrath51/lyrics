 "lyrics": "How do I say goodbye\nTo what we had?\nThe good times that made us laugh\nOutweigh the bad\n\nI thought we'd get to see forever\nBut forever's gone away\nIt's so hard to say goodbye\nTo yesterday\n\nI don't know where this road\nIs going to lead\nAll I know is where we've been\nAnd what we've been through, ooh\n\nIf we get to see tomorrow\nI hope it's worth all the wait\nIt's so hard to say goodbye\nTo yesterday\n\nAnd I'll take with me the memories\nTo be my sunshine after the rain\nIt's so hard to say goodbye\nTo yesterday\nAnd I'll take with me the memories\nTo be my sunshine after the rain\nIt's so hard to say goodbye\nTo yesterday",
