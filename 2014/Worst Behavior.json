Motherfucker never loved us\nRemember? Motherfucker\nRemember? Motherfucker never loved us\nI'm on my worst behavior\nDon't you ever get it fucked up\nMotherfuckers never loved us\nMan, motherfuckers never loved us\nWorst behavior\nMotherfuckers never loved us\nFucker never loved us\nWorst behavior\n\nHold up, hold my phone\nMotherfuckers never loved us\nFucker never loved us\nNow you want to roll one\nMotherfucker never loved us\nSo everywhere we go now, full cup\nAlways hated the boy, but now the boy is the man\nMotherfucker, I done growed up\nYou know me? You know me?\nI'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me\nYou owe me, you owe me\nBitch, you better have my money when I come for that shit like O.D.B\n\nOn my worst behavior, no?\nThey used to never want to hear us\nRemember? Motherfucker never loved us\nRemember? Motherfucker\nRemember? Motherfucker never loved us\nI'm on my worst behavior\nDon't you ever get it fucked up\nMotherfuckers never loved us\nMan, motherfuckers never loved us\nWorst behavior\nMothafuckers never loved us\nFucker never loved us\nWorst behavior\n\nWho's hot, who not?\nTell me, who rock, who sell out in stores?\nYou tell me who flop, who copped the new drop\nWhose jewels got rocks\nWho else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?\nSame old pimp, \nDrake, you know ain't nothin' changed\nWith these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game\nI just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave\nThen it's back to L.A., \nopen the mail, starin' at the check\nEnough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net\nI'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib\nI swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left\nOh, where I reside it look like a resort inside\nNigga, where your shit from? I imported mine\nBar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai\nFuck you, bitch, I'm more than high\nMy momma probably hear that and be mortified\nThis ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura\n5 a.m. then go and shoot \nDegrassi\n up on Morningside\nFor all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized\nYeah, back and forth across the borderline\nHate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime\nGone all the time, even the important times\nI should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior\n\nRemember?\nRemember? Motherfucker\nRemember?\nHold up, hold my phone\nThey used to never want to hear us\nRemember? Motherfucker never loved us\nRemember? Motherfucker\nRemember? Worst behavior",
