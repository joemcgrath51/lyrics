 "lyrics": "Oh...oh...hey hey\nCome on, come on...\n\nI know you've heard this line a thousand times\nThe way you look tonight just blow my mind\nLet's go some place for we could talk a while\n'Cause I don't wanna lose this vibe\nDon't wanna push you, but where are your friends? Yeah\nAnd I'll make sure that you get home when the party ends\nIs there some place special you would like to go?\nJust as long as you don't say no\n\nDon't wanna waste your time (I don't wanna waste your time)\nSit back and relax your mind (relax your mind)\nI wanna be what you need and more\nJust tell me what you like (what you like, what you like)\n\nGirl, are you hungry? Let me cook for you\nMy place is near, just right up Park Avenue\nI know a place that's not too far away\nFly first class New York to LA\nListen, I know you're feeling me\nI'm feeling you\nSo let's thank this now before we try to make this move\nI won't say words I don't really mean\n'Cause I want you to stay with me\n\nDon't wanna waste your time (don't wanna)\nSit back and relax your mind (sit back and relax your mind)\nI wanna be what you need and more (what you need)\nJust tell me what you like (tell me, tell me what you like, baby)\nDon't wanna waste your time (I don't wanna)\nSit back and relax your mind (tell me what you want from me)\nI wanna be what you need and more (and you know I'll give it to you)\nJust tell me what you like (tell me what you like)\n\nI like it, I like it, I really really like it\nI'm for it, adore it, Boyz II Men, you got me open\nI like it, I like it, I really really like it\nI'm for it, adore it, Boyz II Men, you got me open\nAnd you got me\n\nDon't wanna waste your time (And I don't wanna waste)\nSit back and relax your mind (sit back and relax your mind)\n(Just relax your mind)\nI wanna be what you need and more ('Cause I wanna I wanna be)\nJust tell me what you like\nDon't wanna waste your time (don't wanna waste, no)\nSit back and relax your mind (you sit back and relax your mind)\n(Just relax your mind)\nI wanna be what you need and more\nJust tell me what you like (Ohh yeah)\nJust tell me what you like...",
