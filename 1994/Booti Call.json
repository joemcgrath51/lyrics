Can you help me?\nIt's just a bootie call\nHey baby, turn around\nIt's not what it seems\nThe way I like it by the pound\nMust be in the genes\nOnly want to have fun\nNo time to get sprung\nThat's the way it is on Blackstreet\nAfter all, it's a booty call\nWell, you know what I like\nYou've got it\nJust be there tonight\nI want it, hey, yeah\nYou know that it's right\nAll I wanna do is be\nWhere you're at\n\nWhy must I feel like that\nWhy must I chase the cat\nNothing but the dog in me\nWhy must I feel like that\nWhy must I chase the cat\nNothing but the dog in me\nSometimes I feel that I\nMight want to settle down\nBut on my wedding night I feel\nI'm gonna play around\nLife is too short to lie\nI mean no disrespect at all\nBut if the other woman's on my mind\nOn my life, it's a booty call\nWell, you know what I like\nYou've got it\nJust be there tonight\nI want it\nYou know that it's right\nAll I wanna do is be\nWhere you're at\nWhy must I feel like that\n\nBow wow wow\nYippy yo yippee ay, hey\nYo, Twan take it to the bridge\nEvery dog has his day\nAnd I'm digging on the vibes\nSo we can get together\nMake tonight real live\nChecking out the front\nChecking out the back\nWell, I'll be god damned\nIs it really like that\nSummer's hot\nWinter's freezing\nChasing that cat\nAll through the season\nHey, yo, girl, stop teasing\nCheck your trips\nCause I really wanna stroke\nYou're saying I'll drown\nI'm saying you'll choke\nBack at my place\nFace to face\nI'm trying to be good\nSo we can cut to the chase\nYou know what I like\nAnd, baby, you got it\nCome on, let's get this started\nBack on Blackstreet\nWe can have a ball\nCause after all\nIt's just a booty call\nWell, you know what I like\nYou've got it\nJust be there tonight\nI want it\nYou know that it's right\nAll I wanna do is be\nWhere you're at\nWhy must I feel like that\n\nBow wow wow\nYippy yo yippee ay, hey",
