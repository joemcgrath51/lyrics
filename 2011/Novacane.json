(Ahh)\nShe said, \"Don't let the high go to waste\" (Ooh)\nBut can you taste a little taste?\n\nNovacane, baby, baby (Ohh)\nNovacane, baby, I want you\nFuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb\nLove me now, when I'm gone, love me none\nLove me none, love me none\nNumb, numb, numb, numb\n\nNovacane, novacane, novacane\nNovacane, novacane (Ohh)\nNumb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain\nNumb the pain, numb the pain (Ohh, ohh)\nNovacane, novacane, novacane\nNovacane, novacane\nFor the pain, for the pain (Ohh, ohh, ohh)\nNovacane, novacane (Ooh)\n\nPretty girls involved with me\nMaking pretty love to me, pretty\nPity, pity\nAll the pretty girls involved with me\nMaking pretty love to me, pretty\nPity, pity\nI can't feel a thing, I can't feel, I can't feel a thing\nI can't feel a thing, I can't feel, feel, feel, feel her\nI can't feel, feel her\nNovacane, novacane, novacane\nI can't feel, feel her\nNovacane for the pain, for the pain\nI can't, can't feel her\nFeel her, feel her, ohh\nNovacane, novacane-cane",
