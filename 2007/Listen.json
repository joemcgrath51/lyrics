 "lyrics": "Listen to the song here in my heart\nA melody I start, but can't complete\nListen to the sound from deep within\nIt's only beginning to find release\n\nOh the time has come for my dreams to be heard\nThey will not be pushed aside and turned\nInto your own, all 'cause you won't listen\n\nListen, I am alone at a crossroads\nI'm not at home in my own home\nAnd I've tried and tried\nTo say what's on my mind\nYou should have known, oh\nNow I'm done believin' you\nYou don't know what I'm feelin'\nI'm more than what\nYou've made of me\nI found the voice you think you gave to me\nBut now I've gotta find my own\nYou should have listened\n\nThere was someone here inside\nSomeone I thought had died\nSo long ago\n\nOh, I'm screamin' out\nAnd my dreams will be heard\nThey will not be pushed aside or turned\nInto your own\nAll 'cause you won't listen\n\nListen. I am alone at a crossroads\nI'm not at home in my own home\nAnd I've tried and tried\nTo say what's on my mind\nYou should have known, oh\nNow I'm done believin' you\nYou don't know what I'm feelin'\nI'm more than what\nYou've made of me\nI followed the voice you gave to me\nBut now I've gotta find my own\n\nI don't know where I belong\nBut I'll be moving on\nIf you don't, if you won't\n\nListen to the song here in my heart\nA melody I start, but I will complete\nNow I'm done believin' you\nYou don't know what I'm feelin'\nI'm more than what you made of me\nI followed the voice you think you gave to me\nBut now I've gotta find my own, my own",
