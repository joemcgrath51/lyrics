 "lyrics": "Every now and then, I still get a flashback\nOf the time I spent thinking you could be that one\nShould I have just kept your love?\nYes, I understand, we did have some good times\nOn the other hand, got me crying all night\nIt was too much for my mind\n\nSo even though I left you, I can't forget you\n'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)\nGuess I'll always love you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)\nWhen we were together, you ain't treat me right\nDamn, I really love you, Iain't gonna lie\n'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet)\n\nI still have the box full of things you gave me\nStart to throw it out, something always stops me, yeah\nI'm not as over you as I say\nDeep inside my heart, I made the right decision\nBut it's kinda hard\nWhen your mind is thinking of, did I make a big mistake?\n\nSo even though I left you, I can't forget you\n'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)\nGuess I'll always love you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)\nWhen we were together, you ain't treat me right\nDamn, I really love you, Iain't gonna lie\n'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet)\n\nSee, I don't understand\nLike, somebody is gonna get hurt\nOut of this situation and you just hope it's not you..\nAt times..\nPart of me wants you, part of me don't, part of me is\nMissing you, part of me is gone. Part of me is saying that\nThe love is still strong. Part of me is letting go\n\nSo even though I left you, I can't forget you\n'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)\nGuess I'll always love you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)\nWhen we were together, you ain't treat me right\nDamn, I really love you, Iain't gonna lie\n'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet)",
