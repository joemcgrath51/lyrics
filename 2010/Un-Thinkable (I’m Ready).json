 "lyrics": "Moment of honesty\nSomeone's gotta take the lead tonight, who's it gonna be?\nI'm gonna sit right here and tell you all that comes to me\nIf you have something to say, you should say it right now\n(You should say it right now)\n\nYou give me a feeling that I never felt before\nAnd I deserve it, I think I deserve it\nIt's becoming something that's impossible to ignore\nAnd I can't take it\n\nI was wondering maybe, could I make you my baby?\nIf we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?\nIf you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)\nIf you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)\n\nI know you said to me\nThis is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be\nTime is only wasting, so why wait for eventually?\nIf we gonna do something about it, we should do it right now\n(We should do it right now)\n\nYou give me a feeling that I never felt before\nAnd I deserve it, I know I deserve it\nIt's becoming something that's impossible to ignore\nIt is what we make it\n\nI was wondering maybe, could I make you my baby?\nIf we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?\nOr would it be so beautiful?\nEither way, I'm sayin'\nIf you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)\nIf you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)\n\nYeah, yeah\nSayin'\nWhy give up before we try?\nFeel the lows before the highs\nClip our wings before we fly away (Fly away)\nI can't say, I can't compare\nI'm suspended in the air\nWon't you come be in the sky with me?\n\nI was wondering maybe, could I make you my baby?\nIf we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?\nOr would it be so beautiful?\nEither way, I'm sayin'\nIf you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)\nIf you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)\nIf you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)\nIf you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)",
