 "lyrics": "It was love at first sight\nI know from the way she looked at me\nHer eyes said it all\nLong days and nights, we spent\nUntil she dropped the bomb on me\nWhen she said that she\nWas unhappily married with children\n\nAnd I wish I never met her at all\nEven though I love her so\nShe got love for me\nBut she still belongs to someone else\n\nIt hurts so bad, for sure\nBecause she wants to be with me\nBut she cannot be with me\nShe chose to stay, at home\nSo they could be a family\nFor the children\nBut what about me?\n\n\nMaybe in another life\nThings could be the way we both desired\nIt's a catch-22\nEither way it went\nSomeone had to lose\n\n\nI wish I wish I never met her at all\nI wouldn't hurt so much inside\nOh I wouldn't feel this pain\nIf I never met her at all, at all, at all\nWish I never, wish I never",
