 "lyrics": "How does a\n \nbastard, orphan, son of a whore and a\nScotsman,\n \ndropped in the middle of a forgotten\nSpot in the Caribbean\n \nby providence, impoverished, in squalor\nGrow up to be a hero and a scholar?\n\nThe ten-dollar Founding Father without a father\nGot a lot farther by working a lot harder\nBy being a lot smarter\nBy being a self-starter\nBy fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter\n\nAnd every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted\nAway across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up\nInside, he was longing for something to be a part of\nThe brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter\n\nThen a hurricane came, and devastation reigned\nOur man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain\nPut a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain\nAnd he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain\n\nWell, the word got around, they said, \u201cThis kid is insane, man\u201d\nTook up a collection just to send him to the mainland\n\u201cGet your education, don\u2019t forget from whence you came, and\nThe world's gonna know your name. What\u2019s your name, man?\u201d\n\nAlexander Hamilton\nMy name is Alexander Hamilton\nAnd there's a million things I haven't done\nBut just you wait, just you wait...\n\nWhen he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden\nTwo years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden\nHalf-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick\n[FULL COMPANY EXCEPT HAMILTON (\nwhispering\n)]\nAnd Alex got better but his mother went quick\n[GEORGE WASHINGTON & \nCOMPANY\n, \nBOTH\n]\nMoved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide\nLeft him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside\nA voice saying\n\u201cAlex, \nyou gotta fend for yourself.\n\u201d\nHe started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf\n[BURR & \nCOMPANY\n, \nBOTH\n]\nThere would have been nothin\u2019 left to do\nFor someone less astute\nHe woulda been dead or destitute\nWithout a cent of restitution\nStarted workin', clerkin' for\n \nhis late mother's landlord\nTradin\u2019 sugar cane and rum and all the things he can\u2019t afford\nScammin'\n for every book he can get his hands on\nPlannin'\n for the future\n \nsee him now as he stands on (\nooh\n)\nThe bow of a ship headed for a new land\nIn New York you can be a new man\n[COMPANY & \nHAMILTON\n, \nWOMEN\n, \nMEN\n]\nIn New York you can be a new man (\nJust you wait\n)\nIn New York you can be a new man (\nJust you wait\n)\nIn New York you can be a new man\nIn New York\n, \nNew York\nJust you wait!\n\nAlexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)\nWe are waiting in the wings for you (waiting in the wings for you)\nYou could never back down\nYou never learned to take your time!\nOh, Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)\nWhen America sings for you\nWill they know what you overcame?\nWill they know you rewrote the game?\nThe world will never be the same, oh\n[BURR, \nMEN\n, & \nCOMPANY\n]\nThe ship is in the harbor now\nSee if you can spot him\nJust you wait\nAnother immigrant\nComin\u2019 up from the bottom\nJust you wait\nHis enemies destroyed his rep\nAmerica forgot him\n\nWe fought with him\n\nMe? I died for him\n\nMe? I trusted him\n\nMe? I loved him\n\nAnd me?\n \nI'm the damn fool that shot him\n\nThere's a million things I haven\u2019t done\nBut just you wait!\n\nWhat's your name, man?\n\nAlexander Hamilton!",
