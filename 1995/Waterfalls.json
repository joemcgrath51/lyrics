 "lyrics": "A lonely mother gazing out of the window\nStaring at a son that she just can't touch\nIf at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side\nBut he doesn't realize he hurts her so much\nBut all the praying just ain't helping at all\n'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble\nSo he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how\nAnother body laying cold in the gutter\nListen to me\n\nDon't go chasing waterfalls\nPlease stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to\nI know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all\nBut I think you're moving too fast\n\nLittle precious has a natural obsession for temptation\nBut he just can't see\nShe gives him loving that his body can't handle\nBut all he can say is, \"Baby it's good to me\"\nOne day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror\nBut he doesn't recognize his own face\nHis health is fading and he doesn't know why\nThree letters took him to his final resting place\nY'all, don't hear me\n\nDon't go chasing waterfalls\nPlease stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to\nI know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all\n(Your way or no way)\nBut I think you're moving too fast\nDon't go chasing waterfalls\nPlease stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to\nI know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all\nBut I think you're moving too fast\n\nCome on!\nI seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms\nHave come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray\nIs it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray\nAll ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days\nAnd like His promise is true, only my faith can undo\nThe many chances I blew to bring my life to anew\nClear  blue and unconditional skies\nHave dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries\nMy only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope\nWith such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain\nWho's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?\nWhat a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain\nYou claim the insane, and name this day in time\nFor falling prey to crime\nI say the system's got you victim to your own mind\nDreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true\nBelieve in yourself, the rest is up to me, and you\n\nDon't go chasing waterfalls\nPlease stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to\nI know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all\nBut I think you're moving too fast\nDon't go chasing waterfalls\nPlease stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to\nI know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all\nBut I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast)\nDon't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go)\nPlease stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to\nI know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all\n(I know, I know, your way hey)\nBut I think you're moving too fast",
