What's your sign?\"\nSoon as he buys that wine, I just creep up from behind)\nLet's talk\n\nLook at them, ey-ey-eyes over here\nPop a few bottles like the first of the year\nStare so right, and the visual probably better\nBut I came over just to make things clear\nNo disrespect, girl, we both so grown\nJust want you by my side when I say, \"So long\"\nBeen paying attention, niggas steady missing\nTurning you off, Let me turn you on\nSo I'm gone\n\n(Ask you what your interests are, who you be with?)\nTo convince you, I'm the one you should leave with\n(Things to make you smile, what, what numbers to dial)\nGirl, I got a thing for you, but it ain't no secret\nIf this conversation leads us\nTo the bed room we gon' make love\nCause girl I want to please you\nAnd girl I really need you, so...\n\nLet's talk about you and me\nLet's talk about tonight, baby\nLet's talk about all the good things that could happen if you leave with me\nYou could see 'em hating if you want to\nBut he can't do your body like a player do, girl\n(Who they attracting with that line, \"What's your name? What's your sign?\"\nSoon as he buys that wine, I just creep up from behind)\nLet's talk\n\nUh, she lookin' like a bag of money\nLike a boss, so you know I let her count it for me\nLike to floss, new watch, gold rings\nPeople next door swear I'm dealing cocaine\nMe and O gettin' dough like it's no thing\nNew Maybachs, boy, that's way out of your range\nAll the chicks came like we at a Knicks game\nCarmelo numbers first and the fifteenth\nWe the best in the biz', baby there it is\nI'mma handle mine, little homie handle his\nAt the Portofino, I just bought the top floor\nI'm living like Nino baby, and want more\nNow double that, Rev Run bubble bath\nOverlook the city, blowing out her back\nShe better blow my mind or she can holla back\nI get better with time, and it's a fucking wrap\n\nLet's talk about you and me\nLet's talk about tonight, baby\nLet's talk about all the good things that could happen if you leave with me\nYou could see 'em hating if you want to\nBut he can't do your body like a player do, girl\n(Who they attracting with that line, \"What's your name? What's your sign?\"\nSoon as he buys that wine, I just creep up from behind)\nLet's talk\nLet's talk about you and me\nLet's talk about tonight, baby\nLet's talk about all the good things that could happen if you leave with me\nYou could see 'em hating if you want to\nBut he can't do your body like a player do, girl\n(Who they attracting with that line, \"What's your name?
