Dance with me\nMy drop tops in the parking lot\nAnd I wanna take you back to my spot\nBut we still got a little more time to rock\nSo won't you dance with me... Dance with me!\n\nI can see you over there just chillin' with your girlfriends\nCan't believe you're by yourself you should be here with me\nChillin' with me\nDrinkin' with me, freakin' with me. Oooohhh whoa, whoa!\nI see you looking at me\nI can tell by your eyes that your feeling me\nAnd I really want you to get close to me\nSo won't you dance with me... Dance with me\nMy drop tops in the parking lot\nAnd I wanna take you back to my spot\nWe can snuggle a little, more time to us\nSo won't you dance with me... Dance with me!\n\nI can see it in your eyes that your looking at the time\nYou wanna leave this party and I know you wanna leave with me\nTo chill with me, to drink with me, to freak with me, oh baby!\nI see you looking at me\nI can tell by your eyes that your feeling me\nAnd I really want you to get close to me\nSo won't you dance with me... Dance with me\nMy drop tops in the parking lot\nAnd I wanna take you back to my spot\nWe can snuggle a little, more time to us\nSo won't you dance with me... Dance with me!\nI see you looking at me\nI can tell by your eyes that your feeling me\nAnd I really want you to get close to me\nSo won't you dance with me... Dance with me\nMy drop tops in the parking lot\nAnd I wanna take you back to my spot\nWe can snuggle a little, more time to us\nSo won't you dance with me... Dance with me!\n\nEverybody sing along....\n\nIf you s*** and you know it clap your hands\nIf you s*** and you know it clap your hands\nIf you s*** and you know it and you really wanna show it\nIf you s*** and you know it clap your hands\nYeah!\nI see you looking at me\nI can tell by your eyes that your feeling me\nAnd I really want you to get close to me\nSo won't you dance with me... Dance with me\nMy drop tops in the parking lot\nAnd I wanna take you back to my spot\nWe can snuggle a little, more time to us\nSo won't you dance with me... Dance with me!\nI see you looking at me\nI can tell by your eyes that your feeling me\nAnd I really want you to get close to me\nSo won't you dance with me... Dance with me\nMy drop tops in the parking lot\nAnd I wanna take you back to my spot\nWe can snuggle a little, more time to us\nSo won't you dance with me... Dance with me!\nI see you looking at me\nI can tell by your eyes that your feeling me\nAnd I really want you to get close to me\nSo won't you dance with me... Dance with me\nMy drop tops in the parking lot\nAnd I wanna take you back to my spot\nWe can snuggle a little, more time to us\nSo won't you dance with me... Dance with me!\nI see you looking at me\nI can tell by your eyes that your feeling me\nAnd I really want you to get close to me\nSo won't you dance with me... Dance with me\nMy drop tops in the parking lot\nAnd I wanna take you back to my spot\nWe can snuggle a little, more time to us\nSo won't you dance with me... Dance with me!\nI see you looking at me\nI can tell by your eyes that your feeling me\nAnd I really want you to get close to me\nSo won't you dance with me... Dance with me\nMy drop tops in the parking lot\nAnd I wanna take you back to my spot\nWe can snuggle a little, more time to us\nSo won't you dance with me... Dance with me!",
