 "lyrics": "One for the money (\"one, one, one one\")\nTwo for the show (\"two, two, two two \")\nThree to get the honeys (\"three, three, three three\")\nHere we go (\"hit, hit, hit me\")\n\nM-O-N-E-Y, it's all good with me\nCause finally I can afford the life of luxury\nAnd I remember in the day mamma had to work so hard\nJust to pay the rent, all the money spent, had to get another job\nAnd now we're living in an eight room mansion on the hill\nAnd we sipping on, sipping on champagne when we chill\nAnd we riding the Lex, Coupe, Beamers and the Benz\nAll over the world from the East to the West coast making ends\nSee, we do it\n\n\nThe show is what we live for cause we love to sing\nWe gonna freak you up and down, it's how we do our thing\nAnd to the ladies in the house tonight\nLooking fly, you got it right\nIt's gonna be an afterparty\nAnd I've got to have somebody\nAnd take 'em to my eight room mansion on the hill\nWe'll be sipping on Champagne when we chill\nAnd we're riding in the Lex, Coupe, Beamer and the Benz\nAll the players from the East to the West Coast, we're making ends\nThis is why we do it\n\n\nWhy we sing? Why we sing?\nIt's the joy it brings, joy it brings\nYou know that you like our style, the reason why, yeah\nThe reason why we do what we do\nSee we got a love for the music\nSimple as one two, three, sing it",
