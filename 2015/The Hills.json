Who are you to judge?\nHide your lies, girl, hide your lies (Hide your lies, oh, baby)\nOnly you to trust, only you\n\nI only call you when it's half-past five\nThe only time that I'll be by your side\nI only love it when you touch me, not feel me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah\nI only call you when it's half-past five\nThe only time I'd ever call you mine\nI only love it when you touch me, not feel me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me\nWhen I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe\n\nEwedihalehu\nYene konjo, ewedihalehu\nYene fikir, fikir, fikir, fikir\nYene fikir, fikir, fikir, fikir\nEwedihalehu\nYene konjo, ewedihalehu...",
