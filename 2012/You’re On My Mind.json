 "lyrics": "I come running back to you\nAnd lay it all on the line\n'Cause ain't nothing left to lose\nTalking 'bout the love of a lifetime\nIf we pride ourselves enough\nWe can believe our lives\nBaby love is on the run\nGirl don't you know\nThat you can't hide\n\nWe can find our way babe\nI need you beside me\nHear me when I say girl\n\nYou're on my mind\nYou're on my mind\nOn my mind on my mind on my mind\nYou're on my mind\nOn my mind on my mind on my mind\nYou're on my mind\n\nAnd I mean it girl\nI ain't to proud to beg\nWhen the feeling starts to hurt\nI gotta get you out my head\nAnd we try to see the light\nOf a brand new day, babe\nLove will always win the fight\nCome and rescue me tonight\n\nGirl we can find our way babe\nGirl I need you loving, girl\nBaby hear me when I say girl\nGirl you on my mind on my mind\n\nYou're on my mind\nYou're on my mind\nOn my mind on my mind on my mind (every hour, every minute babe)\nYou're on my mind\nOn my mind on my mind on my mind\nYou're on my mind\nYou're on my mind\nBaby\nHey girl\nCome rescue me tonight\nWhen the feeling starts to burn\nI gotta get you out my head\nThinking 'bout your love\nBaby\nCome get this lovin' girl\nI ain't too proud to beg, please\nI'm just thinking 'bout your love\nBaby, On a mission 'bout your love\nI need your lovin' girl\nBaby, in the morning, in the evening, when you want it baby\nI want your lovin' girl\nI need your lovin' girl",
