 "lyrics": "Tell me it's real\nThis feeling that we feel\nTell me that it's real\nDon't let love come just to pass us by\nTry\nIt's all we have to do\nIt's up to me and you\nTo make this special love last forever more\n\nBaby, you told me that you love me and you'd never leave my side\nThrough the bitter end, through the thick and thin\nYou promised me, baby, that you wasn't going anywhere, yes you did\nBaby, keep it real, let me know just how you feel\n\nTell me it's real\nThis feeling that we feel\nTell me that it's real\nDon't let love come just to pass us by\nTry\nIt's all we have to do\nIt's up to me and you\nTo make this special love last forever more\n\nI can't explain the way you make me feel\nEverytime that you tell me that you love me\nAnd you know you did, so many times\nJust when I thought that love could never be a part of me\nThat's when you came along\nAnd showed me happiness\nBaby, you are the best\nI think you're different from the rest\nI really love you\n\nTell me it's real\nThis feeling that we feel\nTell me that it's real\nDon't let love come just to pass us by\nTry\nIt's all we have to do\nIt's up to me and you\nTo make this special love last forever more\n\nTell me it's real\nThis feeling that I feel\nTell me it's real\nFor your love\nI will do anything\n\nTell me it's real\nThis feeling that we feel\nTell me that it's real\nDon't let love come just to pass us by\nTry\nIt's all we have to do\nIt's up to me and you\nTo make this special love last forever more\n\nDo you really love me? Do you really care? You promised that\nYou'd never leave my side, you promised that you'd always be there\nAnd Momma told me take it slow\nBoy you just don't know\nAnything about love\nIf you and I were meant to be\nYou would know\nIt would show\nBy the end of the son",
