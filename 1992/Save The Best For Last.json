 "lyrics": "Sometimes the snow comes down in June\nSometimes the sun goes 'round the moon\nI see the passion in your eyes\nSometimes it's all a big surprise\nCause there was a time when all I did was wish\nYou'd tell me this was love\nIt's not the way I hoped or how I planned\nBut somehow it's enough\n\nAnd now we're standing face to face\nIsn't this world a crazy place?\nJust when I thought our chance had passed\nYou go and save the best for last\n\nAll of the nights you came to me\nWhen some silly girl had set you free\nYou wondered how you'd make it through\nI wondered what was wrong with you\nCause how could you give your love to someone else\nAnd share your dreams with me\nSometimes the very thing you're looking for\nIs the one thing you can't see\n\nBut now we're standing face to face\nIsn't this world a crazy place?\nJust when I thought our chance had passed\nYou go and save the best for last\n\nSometimes the very thing\nYou're looking for\nIs the one thing you can't see\nSometimes the snow comes down in June\nSometimes the sun goes 'round the moon\nJust when I thought our chance had passed\nYou go and save the best for last\nYou went and saved the best for last",
