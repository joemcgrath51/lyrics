 "lyrics": "Dear Summer, I know you gon' miss me\nFor we been together like Nike Airs and crisp tees\nS dots with Polo fleeces\nPurple label shit with the logo secret\nGimme couple years, shit I might just sneak in\nA couple words and like Peaches & Herb\nWe'll be reunited and it feels so hood\nHave the whole world saying \"How you still so good?\"\nWell I do this in my slumber, Summer\nI ain't none of these half-assed newcomers\nYou know how I do, Summer\nI drop heat, when you bring the sun up\nThe combo make niggas act up,\n \nI pick the gun up\nNiggas back up; they know I'm not no fronter\nI don't talk SHIT, I just flip it Un ya\nSorry Lance, I'm just trying to advance my quotes\nI ain't making you the butt of my jokes\nBut let's not stray from what I came to say\nTo my beloved, think we need some time away\nThey say if you love it, you should let it out its cage\nAnd fuck it, if it comes back, you know it's there to stay\nIt's tugging, at my heart, but this time apart is needed\nFrom the public, who should've gave me the Pulitz'\nInstead gave me they ass to kiss\nBut you know me, thugging 'til the casket dips\nBut still shine light down on all my peers\nI know they weird... some queer, I still want them to share\nIn all the success I received, I know you can't believe\nI still love 'em but they don't love me\nThey like the drunk uncle in your family\nYou know they lame, you feel ashamed\nBut you love em the same\nIt's like when niggas make subliminal records\nIf it ain't directed directly at me, I don't respect it\nYou don't really want it with Hov, for the record\nI put a couple careers on hold,\n \nyou could be next, kid\nKeep entering the danger zone\nYou gon' make that boy Hov put your name in a song\nIf you that hungry for fame, motherfucker, c'mon\nSay when, take ten paces and spin\nBut on another note, 'bout to take another vacay\nOn another boat, goddamn, a motherfucker wrote\nHis way out the hood, and I pray that I stay out for good\nBut any day you know a nigga could\nTry and play like he Suge,\n \nthen I gotta play like Dutch Schultz\nYou pass the dutchie, I blast you, trust me\nNiggas can't fuck with me\nI'm in a good mood, you lucky, I got a good groove\nAnd I ain't trying to fuck my thing up\nBut I will lay down a couple green bucks, get you cleaned up\nNon-Pulp Fiction, Colt four-fifth and\nYoung niggas that blast for me, no religion\n\nListen here, Summer, baby\nI just believe it's the right thing to do\nI got a brand new bitch, Corporate America\nShe showing me a lot of action right now\nAnd I know you put me on my feet and all, but\nI mean, it's time for me to grow\nYou gotta let me go baby, you gotta let me go\n\nI'm done for now, so one for now\nPossibly forever\n, we had fun together\nBut like all good things, we must come to an end\nPlease show the same love to my friends\nDear Summer",
