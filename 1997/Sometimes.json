 "lyrics": "(Gotta do right, cha gotta do right, ahh sometimes)\nTalkin' 'bout a revolution, or maybe just a change of mind\nWorking on my constitution, I began to realize\nI've been doin' wrong forever, trouble was my favourite game, yeah\nBreakin' hearts I tought was so clever\nBut, I'm the one who got hurt playin'\nI never could see it comin', no\nNever could feel it 'til its come and gone\nBut, all of that don't mean nothin', no\nWhen you're all alone\nSometimes you gotta do right to be happy\nOne time you gotta believe in what you feel inside\nSometimes you gotta do right to find happiness\nSometimes, sometimes\n(Gotta do right, cha gotta do right, ahh sometimes)\nYou're lookin' at a transformation\nThat's brought about a change in me\nLove's a brand new situation, never have I felt so free\n'Cause I can see it comin' - yeah\nAnd I can feel it callin' louder. Now\nLovin' is so rewarding - yeah\nWhen you let it out\nSometimes you gotta do right to be happy\nOne time you gotta believe in what you feel inside\nSometimes you gotta do right to find happiness\nSometimes, sometimes\nSometimes you gotta do right to be happy\nOne time you gotta believe in what you feel inside\nSometimes you gotta do right to find happiness\nSometimes, sometimes\n(Gotta do right, cha gotta do right, ahh sometimes, sometimes x4)",
