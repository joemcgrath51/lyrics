 "lyrics": "You can reach me by railway\nYou can reach me by trail-way\nYou can reach me on an airplane\nYou can reach me with your mind\nYou can reach me by caravan\nCross the desert like an Arab man\nI don't care how you get here, just get here if you can\nYou can reach me by sailboat\nClimb a tree and swing rope to rope\nTake a sled and slide down slow, into these arms of mine\nYou can jump on a speedy colt\nCross the border in a blaze of hope\nI don't care how you get here, just get here if you can\nThere are hills and mountains between us\nAlways something to get over\nIf I had my way, then surely you would be closer\nI need you closer\n(Musical break)\nThere are hills and mountains between us\nAlways something to get over\nIf I had my way, then surely you would be closer\nI need you closer\nYou can windsurf into my life\nTake me up on a carpet ride\nYou can make it in a big balloon\nBut you better make it soon\nYou can reach me by caravan\nCross the desert like an Arab man\nI don't care how you get here, just get here if you can\nI don't care, I don't care, I need you right here right now\nI need you right here, right now, right by my side\nYeah,yeah, yeah, yeah\nI don't care how you get here, just- get here if you can",
