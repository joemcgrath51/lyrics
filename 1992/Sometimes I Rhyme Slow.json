 "lyrics": "Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick\nSometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick\nSometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick\nI'm sweeter and thicker than a Chick-O-Stick\nHere's an ice cream cone honey take a lick\nOr go to Bay Plaza and catch a flick\nWore my Timberland boots so I can stomp ticks\nScandalous get a whiff of this, miss\nJust left the yard boys, now I'm blissed\nI feel good per say good state of mind\nDrive a red Sterling and the seats recline\nI love it when a lady treats me kind\nGo to Tavern on the Green and have a glass of wine\nHe say, she say, \nI heard it through the grapevine\nNo static, got an automatic\nToo much of anything makes you an addict\nTeasin, skeezin, all so pleasin\nDon't ask why I got my own reasons\nSmooth B, Greg Nice, Slick Nick clique\nSometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick...\n\nSometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick\nSometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick\nSometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick\n\nSometimes I rhyme slow\nSometimes I rhyme quick\nI was on 125 and Saint Nick\nWaiting on a cab, standing in the rain\nUnder my heart three clouds of pain\nShe got the best of me\nWhat was her destiny?\nMaybe I should lick her with my \nnine millime...ter\nMy mind is in a blur\nCause you could never pay me to think this would occur\nMe and this girl Jane Doe was living together\nWe were inseparable, noone could sever\nAt least that's what I thought\nBut later I fought with her substance\nAnd almost ended up in Supreme Court\nWhen I was on the road doing shows getting ends\nShe was in my Benz getting sniffy with her friends\nAnd even when she \ncrashed my whip I didn't flip\nMy man Slick Nick said Smooth you're starting to slip\nTime went on I started noticing weight loss\nThen I had to ask her was she riding the white horse\nAt first she said no, then she said yo Smooth I'm sorry\nBut I keep having visions of snow, I need blow\nAnd I said whoa, little hottie\nI'm not DeLorean, Gambino or Gotti\nI don't deal coke, and furthermore you're making me broke\nI'll put you in a rehab and I won't tell your folks\nAnd what do you know\nIn 18 months she came home and I let her back in\nAnd now she's sniffing again...\n\nSometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick\nSometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick\nSometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick",
