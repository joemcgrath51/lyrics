 "lyrics": "I gotta get myself together, cuz I got someplace to go\nAnd I'm praying when I get there, I see everyone I know\nI wanna go to heaven, I wanna go to heaven\nSaid I wanna go to heaven, I wanna go to heaven\nDo you wanna go?\n\nCan you picture a place where there a smile on every face\nAnd all the worry, all the stress and all the pressure's been erased\nWalking down a street that's golden\nAngels singing, perfect weather\nEverybody's got a mansion, y'all it just don't get no better\nI wanna go\n\n\nThe only way I can explain it\nIs that in life we go through changes\nThough we know it serves a purpose\nStill sometimes it just seems worthless\nBut this race that I am running\nWhether I run it fast or slow\nLong as I just keep on running\nI'm gonna make it there someday\nI know\n\nThere's a place for us (one day I wanna see it)\nThere's a place for us (and you may not believe it)\nBut I'm just living my life so I can live again\nEveryday I'm getting ready 'cause I wanna make it in\nOoh, heaven!\nI gotta get myself together, cuz I got someplace to go\nAnd I'm praying when I get there, I see everyone I know\nI wanna go to heaven, I wanna go to heaven\nOoh, it gets hard sometimes\nSometimes I lose my way\nBut Lord knows I'm trying\nTo get to Heaven someday\nTo that beautiful city\nSaid, \"I wanna go to Heaven\"\nI wanna go to Heaven\nI wanna go to Heaven\nI wanna go to Heaven\nI wanna go",
