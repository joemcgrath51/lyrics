(Oh)\nMiss Independent (To the fullest)\nThe load never too much, she helping me pull it\nShe shot the bullet that ended that life (Oh)\nI swear to you, the pimp in me just died tonight\nGirl, sometimes, love...\n\nSometimes, love comes around (Ayy)\n(Love comes around, love comes around)\nOh, it comes around\nAnd it knocks you down (Hey, hey)\nJust get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down\nOoh, when it knocks you down, oh (Hey)\nSometimes, love comes around (Ooh-ooh, yeah)\nComes around\nAnd it knocks you down (Oh, whoa)\nJust get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down\nKnocks you down\n\nTell me now, can you make it past your Caspers?\nSo we can finally fly off into NASA\nYou was always the cheerleader of my dreams\nThat seemed to only date the head of football teams\nAnd I was the class clown that always kept you laughing\nWe were never meant to be, baby; we just happened\nSo, please, don't mess up the trick\n\"Hey Young World,\" I'm the new Slick Rick\nThey say I move too quick, but we can't let this moment pass us\nLet the hourglass pass right into ashes\nLet the wind blow the ash right before my glasses\nSo I wrote this love letter right before my classes\nHow could a goddess ask someone that's only average for advice?\nOMG, you listen to that bitch?\nWoe is me, baby, this is tragic\n'Cause we had it, we was magic\nI was flying; now, I'm crashing (Oh)\nThis is bad, real bad\u2014Michael Jackson\nNow I'm mad, real mad\u2014Joe Jackson\nYou should leave your boyfriend now, I'ma ask him\n\nSo you gotta take the good with the bad, happy and the sad\nAnd let it bring a better future than I had in the past\nOh, 'cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did\nI don't wanna fall back on my face again\n(Whoa, whoa, mm) I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call\n(Whoa, whoa) And if it hits better make it worth the fall\nWhen it comes around, hey\n\nSometimes love comes around\n(Love comes around, love comes around)\nComes around, whoa\nAnd it knocks you down\nJust get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down\nGet back up when it knocks you down\nSometimes love comes around (When love comes around)\nWhen love comes around\nAnd it knocks you down (Eh-eh, oh-oh)\nJust get back up when it knocks you down\nKnocks you down (Eh-eh, oh-oh)\nKnocks you down\n\nWon't see it coming when it happens (Eh)\nBut when it happens (Uh-huh)\nYou're gonna feel it, let me tell you now\nYou see when love comes and knocks you down\nOh, no, when it knocks you down\nWon't see it coming when it happens (Oh oh)\nBut when it happens (Ooh)\nYou're gonna feel it, let me tell you now (Tell you now)\nYou see when love comes and knocks you down\nYeah",
