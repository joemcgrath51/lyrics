 "lyrics": "Pulling me further, further than I've been before\nMaking me stronger, shaking me right to the core\nOh, I don't know what's in the stars\nNever heard it from above, the world isn't ours\nBut I know what's in my heart, if you ain't mine I'll be torn apart\n\nI don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone\nSo I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have\nI know it'll kill me when it's over\nI don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now\nI don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone\nSo I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have\nI know it'll kill me when it's over\nI don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now\n\nLove me now, love me now\nOh, oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh, yeah\nLove me now, love me now\nOh, I want you to love me now\n\nSomething inside us knows there's nothing guaranteed\nYeah, girl, I don't need you to tell me that you'll never leave, no\nWhen we've done all that we could to turn darkness into light, turn evil to good\nEven when we try so hard for that perfect kind of love, it could all fall apart\n\nAnd who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone?\nOh I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have\nAnd I know it'll kill me when it's over\nI don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now\n\nLove me now, love me now\nOh, love me now, oh, oh, oh\nLove me now\nLove me now, love me now\nLove me now\n\nOh I don't know how the years will go down, it's alright\nLet's make the most of every moment tonight\n\nI don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone\nSo I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have\nI know it'll kill me when it's over\nI don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now\nI don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone\nSo I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have\nI know it'll kill me when it's over\nI don't wanna think about it, I just wanna love you now\n\nLove me now, love me now\nOh, oh, love you now, oh, oh, oh\nLove me now, love me now\nLove you now\nOh, love you now, oh, oh, oh, oh",
