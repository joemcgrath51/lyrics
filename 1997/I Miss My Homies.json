 "lyrics": "I want ya'll to play this at funerals in the hood\n'Til all this black on black crime stop\nSome say the blind lead the blind\nBut in the ghetto you never know when it's gon' be yo time\n\nSitting in the ghetto thinkin' 'bout\nAll my homies passed away (uuunnnggghhh!)\nCandy painted Cadillacs and triple gold\nThat's how me and my boys rolled\nHow could it be?\nSomebody took my boy from me\nMy best friend's gone\nAnd I'm so all alone\nAnd I really miss my homies\nEven though you're gone away\nI know you're in a better place\nAnd I hope to see you soon someday\n\nI used to hang with my boy, even slang with my boy\nI used to bang with my boy, goddamn I miss my boy\nWe started out youngstas in the park throwin' birds\nIn your hearse, damn it's sad to see my nigga in the dirt\nThe game got me workin', I be perkin', never jerkin'\nStill blowin' dolja fo' ya 'cause I know you're up there workin'\nYour little baby's cool and ya baby's mama straight\nBut today's a sad day to see your t-shirts with your face\nFrom the cradle to the grave, from the streets we used to fall\nIn the park you liked to ball, put yo name upon the wall\nIn the projects you's a legend, on the street you was a star\nBut it's sad to see my homeboy ridin' in that black car\nA lotta soldiers done died, a lotta mothers done cried\nYou done took yo piece of the pie but you was too young to retire\nWhy soldiers ride for yo name, leave it vain\nSome Gs never change, damn they killed you for some change\nSmile for my homie Kevin Miller my boy Randall\nThe ghetto persons that lost their loved ones to these ghetto scandals\nTake a minute to smile for the dead (uuunnnggghhh!)\nSmile for the dead (RIP 2Pac, Makaveli, Biggie Smalls)\nAll my homies who done made it to the crossroads\n\nHow could it be?\nSomebody took my boy from me\n(It's like I can't believe you gone)\nMy best friend's gone\n(Sometimes I feel like I can't go on)\nAnd I'm so all alone\n(Everytime I see something you done left)\nI really miss my homies\n(It just remind me, more and more of you, dawg)\nEven though they gone away\n(I just keep reminiscin')\nI know you in a better place\n('Cause I know you alright)\nAnd I hope to see ya soon someday\n(And I keep smilin', knowin' I'm a see you in the crossroads)\n\nWe used to grip on the grain and flip them candy toys\nBut I'd give up all that bullshit if I could get back my boy\nOff in the club smokin' weed 'til 3, hollerin' at the hoes\nSpendin' $4000 on me on gators and clothes\nWhen I turned to rap, he had to chase the game\nNigga told me, \"C, leave that dope, 'cause rappin' is yo thang\"\nI ain't gon' even lie, some nights I ride and cry\nWonderin' why the real niggas always the ones to die\nSo I just smoke my weed and try to clear my mind\nI wish that I had the power to turn back the hands of time\nI wonder if there's a heaven up there for real Gs\nFor all the niggas in the game that be sellin' ki's\nI keep my memories, try to keep my head strong\nBut baby it's hard to be strong, when yo main homie gone\n\nEven though you gone away\n(Even though you gone, you ain't never gon' be forgotten)\nI know you in a better place\n('Cause as long as I'm here\nYou gon' live through me and other TRU playas)\nI really miss my homies\nEven though they're gone away\nI know you in a better place\nAnd I hope to see ya soon someday\n\nI'm just sittin' here dazed thinkin' about all the times we had\nThinkin' about the past, some was good and some was bad\nRemember Dante? It was a group of us, just a group of five\nNow three dead, one in jail, it seem right now I'm the only one alive\nTo all my soldiers before me, may y'all rest in peace\nWhen He took three, took my soul, just the bodies\nHe at the crossroads guide us out to the rest of me\nWishin' I could rewind time like demos\nMe and you gettin' girls, writin' down numbers like memos\nMakin' million dollar bets, makin' all our money stretch like limos\nEven though I smile, it's sad, but they say gangstas can't cry\nBut if I close my eyes and visualize me together then I suddenly wanna smile\nSee you laid down when it's yo time, when your time was up\nYou never seen your child, but he's here to remind us\nEven though you was wrong, I never could believe that that was true\nYou was with me forever, you could check my rest in peace tattoos\nSee me and P and C forever gon be ridin' and thuggin'\nRest in peace to all the ones that didn't make it\nAnd rest in peace to my brother\nWe gon' miss you\n\n(I love these fools)\nI know you in a better place\n(Every time I get on my knees)\nAnd I hope to see ya soon someday\n(I pray for you, I'm glad you in a better place\nI hope I see ya soon, ain't no more killin'\nAin't no more fights, and ain't no more tears)",
