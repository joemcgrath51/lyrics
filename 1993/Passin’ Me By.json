 "lyrics": "Now in my younger days I used to sport a shag\nWhen I went to school I carried lunch in a bag\nWith an apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss\nAlways got mad when the class was dismissed\nBut when it was in session, I always had a question\nI would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and\nHelp me with my problem, it was never much\nJust a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch\nOh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug\nShe was married to the man, he was a thug\nHis name was Lee, he drove a Z\nHe'd pick her up from school promptly at 3 o' clock\nI was on her jock, yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus\nFirst I'd write her name then carve a plus\nWith my name last, on the looking glass\nI seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass\n\nShe keeps on passing me by\nShe keeps on passing me by\n(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on passing me by\n(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on pa--\n\nWhen I dream of fairytales I think of me and Shelly\nSee she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me\nThat I should quit chasin' and look for something better\nBut the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter\nI haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her\nI just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture\nI'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger\nShe could be my broad and I could be her nigga\nBut, all I can do was stare\nBack as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare\nNow she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated\nNot at all overrated, I think I need a prayer\nTo get in her book and it looks rather dry\nI guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye\nAlthough she's crazy stepping, I'll try and stop her stride\n'Cause I won't have no more of this passing me by\n\nTime for me to voice my opinion can't be pretending she didn't have me\nSprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie\nShe was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan\nDamn, she looked good, downside: she had a man\nHe was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop\nShe told me soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop\nShe was a flake like corn and I was born not to understand\nBy letting her pass I had proved to be a better man\n\nShe keeps on passing me by\nShe keeps on passing me by\n(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on passing me by\n(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on passing me\n\nNow there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian\nAnd now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when-\nEver she happens to walk by - why does the apple of my eye\nOverlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?\nWait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence\nAnd I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence\nFrom a distance I desired her, secretly admired her\nWired her a letter to get her\nAnd it went, \"My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you\nVery well now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you\nWhen I try or make some sort of attempt, I simp\nDamn I wish I wasn't such a wimp\n'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so and if I was your man then I would be true\nThe only lying I would do is in the bed with you\"\nThen I signed \"Sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, PS Love Me Tender\"\nThe letter came back three days later: Return to Sender, damn\n\nShe keeps on passing me by\nShe keeps on passing me by\n(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on passing me by\n(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on passing me by\n(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on pa--\n(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\nPassing me by\n(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\n(Nevertheless)\n(Nevertheless)\n(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on passing me by\nShe keeps on passing me by\n(I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on passing me by\nShe keeps on passing me by\n(I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on passing me by\nShe keeps on passing me by\n(I'll say it again)\nShe keeps on passing me by\nShe keeps on passing me by\n(I'll say it again)",
