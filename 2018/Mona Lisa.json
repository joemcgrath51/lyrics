 "lyrics": "I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee\nHope it ain't too many feelings involved\n\nI see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles\nGettin' drunk with these bitches, and when they leave they get followed\nFall asleep with that bitch and really don't know much about her\nThen she let us in, we take all of your shit, and when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it\n\nI be with bitches that be with bitches that be with niggas with riches\nI tell her, \"Get him,\" she say, \"I got you,\" I say, \"No, bitch, I said get him\"\nAnd they so pretty, and they hair lengthy, he hit it and sleep on her titties\nThen she give us the word, we come through with AKs, it's a stick-up, she scream like a victim\nNow you feelin' so silly, I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)\nNappy-ass dreads, what's that you say? Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)\nYou can get snaked, you can get faked out by the bitch that you feelin'\n'Cause you thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee\nAnd you tellin' your business, she tell me your business, you tell that bitch what you feelin'\nAll of the beans you be spillin', to you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's\nShe know where you hide it tell me where it's hidden, she know when you're gone, tell me when to visit\nWe break in your home and take the specifics, and meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him\nSo she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains, we find out addresses, and we don't leave messes\nYou'll only know that it's gone when you checkin', then your first thought is to start second guessin'\nShe say, \"What's wrong?\" He say, \"Nothin', keep restin',\" she say, \"What's missin'?\" \"How you know somethin' missin'?\"\nHe scratch his head, she say, \"Get back in bed,\" and she gave him some head\nBoy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say, \"Ooh\"\n\nI see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles\nGettin' drunk with these bitches, then when they leave they get followed\nI be with bitches that know the bitches that's with the niggas we followin'\nGet them on the line, stay two cars behind and tell them hoes, \"Don't be so obvious!\"\nMona Lisa, long hair, don't care\nShe handle the business and don't ever tell, she bite the bullet and cough up the shells\nShe tell 'em, \"Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,\" and if he say yeah, then we meet him there\nShe feed him lies with his silverware, she don't want love, she just want her share\n\nI know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is\nSo he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears, and then she tell me and I be all ears\nAnd then I go and tell my people, and they already know him, and then I call Liz, and she say he comin' over\nI say, \"Good girl, just remember what I told you,\" she gave me the salute, I say, \"Girl, you're a soldier\"\nWe're waitin' outside, watch him pull up, walk up to the door and right before he knock\nShe open the door naked, she left it unlocked, they started French kissin' so he didn't see moi\nAnd then she let him in, they stopped on the couch, music up loud with his head in the clouds\nTurn that shit down, and I scared the piss out of him, piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown\n\"Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around, I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down\nYou know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up, Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down\"\nAnd then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her, she a good actress, and you a dead actor\nYou'll be dead after we get what we're after, if Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh\nI got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga, but think for me, nigga\nSend her to you like she ain't for me, nigga, I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga\nShe pour you a drink, that drank on me, nigga, she slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga\nMona Lisa, I done painted the picture, Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas\nPussy got you out of character, nigga, you fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga\nTake everythin' that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion, we have your attention\nAnd now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga, now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga\nWe just lookin' for the casserole, nigga, but she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (Mona)\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & \nLil Wayne\n]\nAh, every day she wake up with a different color makeup and a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall\nChillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter, four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball\nPaparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh, probably on a Internet blog\nIn a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow\n(\nMona Lisa\n)\n \nPussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls\nAnd he diggin' in it like he livin' in it, make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God\nPoetry in a pear tree, sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him\nDid he want to make love in a yellow taxi? Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat\nWoke up in the mornin' to \nThe Great Gatsby\n,\n \nthen he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie\nI'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughin', I'ma call up again like I did last week\nMake good with the friend and I'm all jazzy, Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley\nFound out that I fucked, he was unhappy, bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me\nBetter yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me 'bout a motherfuckin' double standard, actin'\nFuckin' on another nigga, that's a negative alone, but you sucked his dick? That's just nasty\nMatter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (\nNo\n) You fuckin' with Wayne's? (\nNo!\n)\nBitch, gimme your phone! (\nNo! Let me, let me take this call real quick\n) (\n\u2026 lick me like a lollipop\n)\nHe on your fuckin' ringtone? Is that the shit that you do? Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos\nJump on the internet, watchin' his interviews, I don't know what the fuck lately got into you\nTell me who love you, I bet I love harder,\n \nforgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?\nThe Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma, daycare after school and she never did charge you\nYou scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up, you know what? I give up, let me go get my gun\nI got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin', goddammit, you know that the damage is done\nBitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress, I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess\nSo in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy, I'm killin' myself\n[Outro: Lil Wayne and \nKendrick Lamar\n]\nShe say, \n\"Ooh,\n Daddy, \nooh,\"\n Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa\nOoh\n, fake smile (\nOoh\n), Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa\nShe say, \n\"Ooh,\"\n no emotion (\nOoh\n), Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa\nNow he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah",
