I guess tomorrow knows\nI run through chicks like borrowed clothes\nI'm the type of nigga your father oppose, never test Jay\nYou follow the code, ese, on my best day\nI'm like God with the flow, bless me\n\nBaby, why are you chasing that man?\nKnowing that he can't, love you like I can\nI guess you'd rather chase, instead of feeling what's real inside\nI got to thinking, and I hope you realize\n\nAll this love for free\nBetter come and get it soon (Hurry hurry)\nPlease, don't take too long (I want your love babe)\nBefore it's all gone, I just wanna put you on\n\nThe apple of my eye, sweet cherry surprise\nLet me up inside, of your body tonight\nThere's so much that we can do, me\nAnd I'll do you, know how much I wanna\nTaste your loving, so good\n\nAll this love for free\nBetter come and get it soon (Hurry hurry)\nPlease, don't take too long (I want your love babe)\nBefore it's all gone, I just wanna put you on\n\nHurry hurry hurry, hurry baby 'cause I can't wait\nHurry hurry hurry, 'cause later on might be too late (Gotta hurry)\nHurry hurry hurry, tell me whatcha gonna do\nHurry hurry hurry, there's too many dimes for me to choose\n\nBaby you got me (got me going)\nGoing round in circles (tell me why)\nAnd I can't explain why (I need your love)\nCan't get enough of your love\n\nYeah yeah yeah\nIn the SL with Rell, music at a high decimal\nMami fronting, touching buttons like she spec-ial\n'Cause she sex well, and the best tail, \nRoc-A-Fella cartel\nExcel-ing like Hyundai\n, Sunday to Sunday\nIt's for the nachos, come out the clothes\nAnd baby girl if it's Hammer time then hide your toes\nThe game cold like, five below, but once inside the show\nWe tore it down; about that money, we throw it around\nSo when the ice hit the sun rays, run for shade\nGame's over, we didn't come to play\nThe fuck y'all thinking?\n\nRound and round in circles\n(Tell me why) I can't explain why\n(I need your love) Can't get enough of your love\nBaby I've got all this love (all this love for free)\n(Better come and get it soon) Baby baby baby\n(Please don't take too long) I want your love babe\n(Before it's all gone, I just wanna put you on)\nCan you feel me growing baby\n(All this love for free... Better come and get it soon...)\nLet me keep it going...",
