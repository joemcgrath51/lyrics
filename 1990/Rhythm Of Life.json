 "lyrics": "Climbin' every mountain, always killing time\nCount the cost as days go by\nMonday I've got Friday on my mind\nWhy don't we make love\nInstead of making plans\nMother Nature, Father Time\nMaybe it's the family of man\nAngels cry when they hear that tune\nIt's sleepless nights for the man in the moon\nAnd it's the rhythm of life\nMy mind's made up\nLucy's sign is the Chinese dragon\nOh, oh, she's got luck\nThe rhythm of life is the force of habit\nOh, oh, the rhythm of life\nGive the girl a future\nGive her what she needs\nTeach her life's a Iong, flat road\nMaybe she'll have better luck than me\nWorks so hard like he's still in school\nHis pockets are jammed, but this man's a fool\nWithin the rhythm of life\nMy mind's made up\nLucy's sign is the Chinese dragon\nOh, oh-oh, she's got luck\nThe rhythm of life is the force of habit\nYeah-yeah, oh, the rhythm of life\nRhythm of life\nOh, when out of sight is out of mind\nShut your mouth, I'm doing fine\nMama's goin' back in time\nWithin the rhythm of life\n(Life goes on)\nIt's goin' on and on, hey yeah\n(The rhythm of life goes on)",
