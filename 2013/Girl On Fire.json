 "lyrics": "She's just a girl, and she's on fire\nHotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway\nShe's living in a world, and it's on fire\nFeeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away\n\nOh, she got both feet on the ground\nAnd she's burning it down\nOh, she got her head in the clouds\nAnd she's not backing down\n\nThis girl is on fire\nThis girl is on fire\nShe's walking on fire\nThis girl is on fire\n\nLooks like a girl, but she's a flame\nSo bright, she can burn your eyes\nBetter look the other way\nYou can try, but you'll never forget her name\nShe's on top of the world\nHottest of the hottest girls say\n\nOh, we got our feet on the ground\nAnd we're burning it down\nOh, got our head in the clouds\nAnd we're not coming down\n\nThis girl is on fire (fire, fire)\nThis girl is on fire\nShe's walking on fire (fire, fire)\nThis girl is on fire (Oh)\n\nEverybody stands, as she goes by\n'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes\nWatch her when she's lighting up the night\nNobody knows that she's a lonely girl\nAnd it's a lonely world\nBut she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby\n\nThis girl is on fire (Fire, fire)\nThis girl is on fire\nShe's walking on fire (Fire, fire)\nThis girl is on fire\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...\nShe's just a girl, but she's on fire",
