Mike Jones\nThe one and only, you can't clone me\nGot a lot of haters and a lot of homies, some friends and some phony\n\nBack then ho's didn't want me, now I'm hot ho's all on me\nBack then ho's didn't want me, now I'm hot ho's all on me\nBack then ho's didn't want me, now I'm hot ho's all on me (I said!)\nBack then ho's didn't want me, now I'm hot ho's all on me\n\nStill tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues\nTippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues\nTippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues\nPimpin' fo' hoes and I'm packin' fo' fo's\nStill tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues\nTippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues\nTippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues\nPimpin' fo' hoes and I'm packin' fo' fo's\n\nWhat it do? It's Paul Wall, I'm the People's Champ\nMy chain light up like a lamp 'cause now I'm back with the camp\nI'm crawlin' similar to an ant, 'cause I'm low to the Earth\nPeople's feelings get hurt, when they figure out what I'm worth\nI got eighty fo's pokin' out, at the club I'm showin' out\nI'm a player, ain't no doubt, hoes want to know what I'm 'bout\nBiggest diamonds off in my mouth, princess cuts all in my chain\nWood grain all in my range, drippin' stains when I switch lanes\nSwitched the name, it's still the same, SwishaHouse or SwishaBlast\nMike Jones, he runnin' the game and Magnificent 'bout his cash\nMichael Watts, he made me hot, hard work took me to the top\nG. Dash took me to the lot, he wrote a check and bought a drop\nI got the internet goin' nuts but T. Farris got my back, so now I'm holdin' my nuts\nIt's Paul Wall baby, what you know 'bout me?\nI'm on that five nine Southlea, baby, holler at me\n\nStill tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues\nTippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues\nTippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues\nPimpin' fo' hoes and I'm packin' fo' fo's\nStill tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues\nTippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues\nTippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues\nPimpin' fo' hoes and I'm packin' fo' fo's",
