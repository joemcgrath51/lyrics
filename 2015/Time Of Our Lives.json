I want the time of my life\nOh baby, ooh...\nGive me the time of my life\nEh, eh, eh\nLet's get it now\n\nMr. Worldwide\nNe-yo\nThis is the last $20 I got\nBut I'mma have a good time ballin' or out\nTell the bartender, line up some shots\nCause I'mma get loose tonight\nShe's on fire, she's so hot\nI'm no liar, she burn up the spot\nLook like Mariah, I took another shot\nTold her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot\nDirty talk, dirty dance\nShe a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man\nShe on the rebound, broke up with her ex\nAnd I'm like Rodman, ready on deck\nI told her, \"Wanna ride out?\", and she said yes\nWe didn't go to church, but I got blessed\n\nI knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago\nI worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though\nBut I got just enough\nTo get off in this club\nHave me a good time, before my time is up\nHey, let's get it now\n\nOooh!!  I want the time of my life\nOh baby ooh give me the time of my life\nEh, eh, eh\nLet's get it now\n\nTonight I'mma lose my mind\nBetter get yours cause I'm gonna get mine\nParty every night, like my last\nMami know the drill, shake that ass\nGo ahead baby let me see what you got\nYou know you got the biggest booty in this spot\nAnd I just wanna see that thing drop\nFrom the back to the front to the top\nYou know me I'm off in the cut\nAlways like a squirrel, looking for a nut\nThis isn't for show I'm not talking 'bout luck\nI'm not talking 'bout love, I'm talking 'bout lust\nNow let's get loose, have some fun\nForget about bills and the first of the month\nIt's my night, your night, our night, let's turn it up\n\nI knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago\nI worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though\nBut I got just enough\nTo get off in this club\nHave me a good time, before my time is up\nHey, let's get it now\n\nOooh!!  I want the time of my life\nOh baby ooh give me the time of my life\nEh, eh, eh\nLet's get it now\n\nEverybody goin' through something\n(Everybody goin' through something)\nI said, everybody goin' through something\n(Everybody goin' through something)\nSo you might as well you roll it up\nPour it up, drink it up, throw it up tonight\nI said, everybody goin' through something\n(Everybody goin' through something)\nSaid, everybody goin' through something\n(Everybody goin' through something)\nSo you might as well you roll it up\nPour it up, drink it up, throw it up tonight, yeah...\n\nThis for everybody going through tough times\nBelieve me, been there, done that\nBut every day above ground is a great day, remember that\u2014Dali!\n\nI knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago\nI worked my ass off, but I still can't pay it though\nBut I got just enough\nTo get off in this club\nHave me a good time, before my time is up\nHey, let's get it now\n\nOooh!!  I want the time of my life\nOh baby ooh give me the time of my life\nLet's get it now",
