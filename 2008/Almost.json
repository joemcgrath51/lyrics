 "lyrics": "Can you tell me how can one miss what she's never had?\nHow could I reminisce when there is no past?\nHow could I have memories of being happy with you, boy?\nCan someone tell me how can this be?\nHow could my mind pull up incidents\nRecall dates and times that never happened?\nHow could we celebrate a love that's too late\nAnd, how could I really mean the words I'm 'bout to say?\n\nI miss the times that we almost shared\nI miss the love that was almost there\nI miss the times that we used to kiss\nAt least in my dreams, just let me take my time and reminisce\nI miss the times that we never had\nWhat happened to us? We were almost there\nWhoever said it's impossible to miss what you never had\nNever almost had you\n\nI can not believe I let you go\nOr what I should say is\nI should have grabbed you up and never let you go\nI should have went out with you\nI should have made you my boo, boy\nYeah, that's one time I should have broke the rules\nShould have went on a date\nShould have found a way to escape\nShould have turned it almost into if it happened, now it's too late\nHow could I celebrate a love that wasn't real?\nAnd if it didn't happen, why does my heart feel?\n\nI miss the times that we almost shared\nI miss the love that was almost there\nI miss the times that we used to kiss\nAt least in my dreams, just let me take my time and reminisce\nI miss the times that we never had\nWhat happened to us? We were almost there\nWhoever said it's impossible to miss what you never had\nNever almost had you\n\n(Sometimes I wanna plug ya\nSome nights I want to hug you)\nAnd you seemed to be the perfect one for me\nYou\n(Sometimes I wanna touch you\nBut tonight I wanna love you)\nYou're all I ever wanted\nYou're my everything, yes it's true\nBoy, it's hard to be close to you\nMy love, I know it may sound crazy\nBut I'm in love with you\n\nI miss the times that we almost shared\nI miss the love that was almost there (Almost there)\nI miss the times that we used to kiss\nAt least in my dreams just let me take my time and reminisce\nI miss the times that we never had\nWhat happened to us? We were almost there\nWhoever said it's impossible to miss what you never had\nNever almost had you\n\nI miss the times that we almost shared\nI miss the love that was almost there\n(Sometimes I wanna plug ya)\nI miss the times that we used to kiss\nAt least in my dreams, let me take my time and reminisce\n(But tonight I wanna love you)\nI miss the times that we never had\nWhat happened to us? We were almost there\nWhoever said it's impossible to miss what you never had\nNever almost had you, baby\n(Said I miss you, really, really miss you)\n(But tonight I wanna love you)",
