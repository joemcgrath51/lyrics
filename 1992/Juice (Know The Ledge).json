 "lyrics": "Sip the juice, I got enough to go around\nAnd the thought takes place Uptown\nI grew up on the sidewalk where I learned street talk\nAnd then taught to hawk New York\nI go to Queens for queens, then get the crew from Brooklyn\nMake money in Manhattan and never been tooken\nGo Uptown in The Bronx to Boogie Down\nGet Strong on the Island, recoup and lay around\nTime to build my juice back up\nProps stack up, suckers get smacked up\nDon't doubt the clout, you know what I'm about\nKnockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out\nShakin' 'em up, wakin' 'em up\nBreakin' 'em up, rakin' 'em up\nStandin' on shaky ground too close to the edge\nLet's see if I Know the Ledge\n\nCorner's triflin' 'cause shorty's here\nI get cock-D liftin' forties of beer\nHere's a sip for the crew that's deceased\nIf I get revenge, then they rest in peace\nSomebody gotta suffer, I just might spare one\nAnd give a brother a fair one\nStay alert and on P's and I do work with these like Hercules\nSwitch to southpaw, split your right jaw\n'Cause I don't like y'all, I'm hype when night fall\nSmooth but I move like an army\nBulletproof down in case brothers try to bomb me\nPuttin' brothers to rest like Eliot Ness\n'Cause I don't like stress\nStreets ain't the place for innocent bystanders to stand\nNothing's gonna stop the plan\nI'll chill like Pacino, kill like DeNiro\nBlack Gambino, die like a hero\nLivin' on shaky grounds, too close to the edge\nLet's see if I Know the Ledge\n\nShells lay around on the battleground\nDead bodies are found throughout the town\nTry to put shame in my game to make a name\nI'mma put it on a bullet, put it in your brain\nRip the block like a buckshot\nWho cares where it goes? Just keep the casket closed\nNo remorse when a life is lost\nI paid my dues, paid the cost\nAnd my pockets are still fat\nWherever I'm at, I get the welcome mat\nEven if my crew asleep, I'm one deep\nI attract attention, people like to peep\nSo come say hi to the bad guy\nDon't say goodbye, I don't plan to die\n'Cause I get loose and I got troops, and crazy juice\nIn control of many like Ayatollah Khomeini\nHang out with Smith and Wess', don't try to play me\nI'm at war a lot, like Anwar Sadat\nBut no warnin' shot, my gun is warm a lot\nWhen I cook beef, the smoke will never clear\nAreas in fear 'cause this here's severe\nLivin' life too close to the edge\nHopin' that I Know the Ledge\n\nA brand new morn', no time to yawn\nShower's on, power's on\nLate for school, I catch the train\nGirls sip the style and whisper my name\nI push up like an exercise\nCheck they intellect and inspect the thighs\nSelect the best one, pull her to the side\nKeep her occupied for the rest of the ride\nRead her my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, she know already? Cool\nJust meet me after school\nWe can moan and groan until your moms come home\nAnd you'll be callin' me Al \"Dope\" Capone\nSweatin' me, she didn't want to let me loose\nCome get me, that's if you want to sip the juice\n'Cause the streets await me, so I take my gun off safety\n'Cause a lot of niggas hate me\nComin' out of the building, they set me up\nSprayed with automatics, they wet me up\nIn a puddle of blood, I lay close to the edge\nI guess I didn't Know the Ledge",
