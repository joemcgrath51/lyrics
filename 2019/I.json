 "lyrics": "Feeling used, but I'm\nStill missing you and I can't\nSee the end of this\nJust wanna feel your kiss against my lips\nAnd now all this time is passing by\nBut I still can't seem to tell you why\nIt hurts me every time I see you\nRealize how much I need you\n\nI hate you, I love you\nI hate that I love you\nDon't want to, but I can't put\nNobody else above you\nI hate you, I love you\nI hate that I want you\nYou want her, you need her\nAnd I'll never be her\n\nI miss you when I can't sleep\nOr right after coffee or right when I can't eat\nI miss you in my front seat\nStill got sand in my sweaters\nFrom nights we don't remember\nDo you miss me like I miss you?\nFucked around and got attached to you\nFriends can break your heart, too\nAnd I'm always tired, but never of you\nIf I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit\nI put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit\nI type a text, but then I never mind that shit\nI got these feelings, but you never mind that shit\nOh oh, keep it on the low\nYou're still in love with me, but your friends don't know\nIf you wanted me, you would just say so\nAnd if I were you, I would never let me go\n\nI hate you, I love you\nI hate that I love you\nDon't want to, but I can't put\nNobody else above you\nI hate you, I love you\nI hate that I want you\nYou want her, you need her\nAnd I'll never be her\n\nI don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm\nWedding bells were just alarms\nCaution tape around my heart\nYou ever wonder what we could have been?\nYou said you wouldn't and you fucking did\nLie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix\nNow all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed\nAlways missing people that I shouldn't be missing\nSometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance\nI know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing\nBut I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings\nWhen love and trust are gone\nI guess this is moving on\nEveryone I do right does me wrong\nSo every lonely night, I sing this song\n[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien  \nwith gnash\n]\nI hate you, I love you\nI hate that I love you\nDon't want to, but I can't put\nNobody else above you\nI hate you, I love you\nI hate that I want you\nYou want her, you need her\nAnd I'll never be her\n[Bridge: Olivia O'Brien \nwith gnash\n]\nAll alone, I watch you watch her\nLike she's the only girl you've ever seen\nYou don't care, you never did\nYou don't give a damn about me\nYeah, all alone, I watch you watch her\nShe is the only thing you've ever seen\nHow is it you never notice\nThat you are slowly killing me?\n\nI hate you, I love you\nI hate that I love you\nDon't want to, but I can't put\nNobody else above you\nI hate you, I love you\nI hate that I want you\nYou want her, you need her\nAnd I'll never be her",
