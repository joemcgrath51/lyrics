 "lyrics": "You could buy me diamonds, you could buy me pearls\nTake me on a cruise around the world (Baby, you know I'm worth it)\nDinner lit by candles, run my bubble bath\nMake love tenderly to last and last (Baby, you know I'm worth it)\n\nWanna please, wanna keep, wanna treat your woman right\nNot just dough, but to show that you know she is worth your time\nYou will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first\nShe will and she can find a man who knows her worth\n\n'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her (When he sees her)\nAnd a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her (Please her)\nAnd a real woman knows a real man always comes first\nAnd a real man just can't deny a woman's worth (A woman's worth)\n\nMmm hmm, mmm, hmm\nMmm hmm, mmm, hmm\nMmm, mm (Hold up)\n\nIf you treat me fairly, I'll give you all my goods\nTreat you like a real woman should (Baby, I know you're worth it)\nIf you never play me, promise not to bluff\nI'll hold you down when shit gets rough ('Cause baby, I know you're worth it)\n\nShe walks the mile, makes you smile all the while being true\nDon't take for granted the passions that she has for you\nYou will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first\nShe will and she can find a man who knows her worth\n\nOhh, 'cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her (When he sees her)\nAnd a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her (Please me)\nAnd a real woman knows a real man always comes first (First, baby)\nAnd a real man just can't deny a woman's worth\n\nNo need to read between the lines, spelled out for you (Spelled out for you)\nJust hear this song cause you can't go wrong when you value (Better value)\nA woman's (Woman's) (Sing it) woman's (Woman's) worth\n\n'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her (When he sees her)\nAnd a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her (Please me)\nAnd a real woman knows a real man always comes first (First, baby)\nAnd a real man just can't deny a woman's worth (A woman's worth)\n'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her (Nothing like a woman's worth)\nAnd a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her (Oh-ooh)\nAnd a real woman knows a real man always comes first (Comes first)\nAnd a real man just can't deny a woman's worth (Woman's worth)",
