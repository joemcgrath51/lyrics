 "lyrics": "Yo, ayo, tonight is the night that I'ma get twisted\nMyx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it\nRoll that spaceship, we \u2018bout to get lifted\nLive in the present, that gift is for the gifted\nThis what you came, this what you came for\nYou get what you buy, this what you paid for\nSo make sure the stars is what you aim for, make mistakes though\n\nI never worry, life is a journey\nI just wanna enjoy the ride (Ride, ride)\nWhat is the hurry? It's pretty early\nIt's okay, we'll take our time (Time, time)\n\nThe night is still young, the night is still young\nThe night is still young and so are we\nThe night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)\nThe night is still young (And watch the world pass us by)\nThe night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)\nSo are we\n\nAyo, drinks on you, or the drinks is on me?\nWe ain't goin' nowhere like tanks is on E\nWe still gettin' money, what bank it's gon' be?\nIf he's sexy, he plankin' on me\nSo where them big boys with all of that? (Ayy)\nTell the bartender, say my order back (Ayy)\nIt's bottle service, he ordered that (Ayy)\nMight let him take it home and slaughter that\nHe got friends for all of my friends\nThey ain't leavin' 'til we say when\nAnd we gon' hangover the next day\nBut we will remember this day\nSo drop the pop and get low\nAnd we could drop the top and just cruise\nWe fresh to death, down to the shoes\nMy only motto in life is \"Don't lose\" (Kyuh)\n\nI never worry, life is a journey\nI just wanna enjoy the ride (Ride, ride)\nWhat is the hurry? It's pretty early\nIt's okay, we'll take our time (Time, time)\n\nThe night is still young, the night is still young\nThe night is still young and so are we\nThe night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)\nThe night is still young (And watch the world pass us by)\nThe night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)\nSo are we\n\nWe're just gettin' started, yeah, yeah\nWe're just gettin' started, yeah, yeah\nCan't you see the night's still early?\nAnd we gon' get it wild and crazy\nWe're just gettin' started, yeah, yeah\nWe're just gettin' started, yeah, yeah\nCan't you see the night's still early?\nAnd we gon' get it wild and crazy\n\nThe night is still young, the night is still young\nThe night is still young and so are we\nThe night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)\nThe night is still young (And watch the world pass us by)\nThe night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)\nSo are we\n\nHow dare we sit quietly\nAnd watch the world pass us by\nHow dare we sit quietly\nAnd watch the world pass us by",
