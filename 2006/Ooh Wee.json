Gators\nOr could have been the rim you won\nI think it was the introduction\nPerhaps it was the kiss\n\nBaby ooh wee\nYou were dressed to the night\nYou were looking so fine\nAnd the gangsta smile\nOoh ooh ooh ooh ooh wee mm baby ooh wee\nI ain't lying I would swear and\nLike a 3-57\nSmith Wesson Magnum\nBaby, baby yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nI'm not the kind of girl, who needs expensive things\nBaby no no, don't need no fancy cars, don't need no diamond rings\nJust pay attention to my heart it's telling things\nI'll build the castle out of sand, before a king fit for a queen\n\nYou were dressed to the night\nFell in love with you fine\nAnd that gangsta smile\nOoh ooh ooh ooh ooh wee\nI ain't lying I would swear and\nLike a 3-57\nSmith Wesson Magnum\nBaby, baby yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nOoh he's coming over here\nAnd he got a cane\nJust be easy baby\nDon't let it corrupt you\n\nWasup lil mama\nI picked you up by yo pretty thing\nYou know what I mean?\nUh, what's crackin' with you?\nMmm what you drinkin' on baby?\nI'd like to buy you a drink\nYou know what? We need to come a little bit closer to a playa",
