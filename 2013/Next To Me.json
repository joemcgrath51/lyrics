 "lyrics": "A life of let me downs\nI\u0092ve had to live\nThe world I grew up for\nI had to give\nLost in a routine\nThe sand in my shoes\nForgotten every night\nThat I lie by you\nThat I lie by you\nI am the man who\u0092s followed his dreams\nWho\u0092s been all the places I\u0092ve never seen\nI am the man that I want to be\nWhen you\u0092re lying next to me\nBroken promises\nI\u0092ve had to take\nAnd possibilities\nI\u0092ve had to fake\nChoices that I\u0092ve made\nI can\u0092t undo\nForgotten every night\nThat I lie by you\nThat I lie by you\nI am the man who\u0092s followed his dreams\nWho\u0092s been all the places I\u0092ve never seen\nI am the man that I want to be\nWhen you\u0092re lying next to me\nI feel like I am finally someone\nWho can do all the things I haven\u0092t done\nI am the man that I want to be\nWhen you\u0092re lying next to me\nHold on to me\nI am the man who\u0092s followed his dreams\nWho\u0092s been all the places I\u0092ve never seen\nI am the man that I want to be\nWhen you\u0092re lying with me\nI feel like I am finally someone\nWho can do all the things I haven\u0092t done\nI am the man that I want to be\nWhen you\u0092re lying next to me",
