 "lyrics": "Don't understand why you can't see through me\nMy heart is one, calling out to you\nNo other love can give you what you're needing\nNo one is there like I am for you\nHe'll never change your life\nHe'll never change your life, girl\nHe doesn't know you like I do\nHe don't know you at all\nAll I can ask is your time\nJust a little of your time, baby\nAll I can ever want is a chance to prove\nI'm tellin' you, my heart wants to be there for you\nYour heart, is it someone there?\nMy heart wants to be there for you, love\nMy heart wants to be there\nYou want to be a full time affection\nHe only gives when he's here to give\nMy love is here to give you direction\nBut how can you have what you just won't believe\nHe'll never change your life\nHe'll never change you, girl\nHe doesn't know you like I do\nHe don't know you at all\nAll I can ask is your time\nFive minutes alone, baby\nAll I can ever want is a chance to prove\nMy heart wants to be there for you\nYour heart, is it someone there?\nMy heart wants to be there for you, love\nBe there for you, love\nYou never change your life\nYou never change your life\nHe doesn't know you like I do\nHe don't know you at all, baby\nAll I can ask is your time\nJust five minutes of your time, girl\nAll I can ever want is a chance to prove\nI'm telling you, my heart wants to be there for you\nYour heart, is it someone there?\nMy heart wants to be there for you, love\nMy heart wants to be there for you\nYour heart, is it someone there?\nMy heart wants to be there for you, love\nMy heart wants to be there for you\nYour heart, is there someone there?\nMy heart wants to be there for you, love",
