Anytime, yeah\nAin't no sunshine (Ain't no sunshine)\nAin't no sunshine (Ain't no sunshine)\nAin't no sunshine, anytime (Damn)\n\nSo if you don't want to do no time\nYou better take time to try to draw the line\nYou know what I'm saying?\nOr you're going to be the next fool in line doing time\nYou know what I'm saying?\nLike my man said\nAin't no sunshine (Ain't no sunshine fool)\nAin't no sunshine (Ain't nothing happening up there\nYou know what I'm saying?) Ain't no sunshine, anytime\n(Yo, me and Frost is out of here, peace)\nThere just ain't no sunshine",
