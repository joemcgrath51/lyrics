Ah)\nHerm\u00e8s link, ice-blue mink (Woo!)\nTat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is (Yah!)\nThey want me gone, wait for the kicker\nBury me now and I only get bigger\nThat's word to my nigga (Woo!)\n\nYeah, October Firm in the cut (Yah!)\nStay at the top like I'm stuck, that's just how I'm givin' it up\nShe wanna get married tonight\nBut I can't take a knee, 'cause I'm wearin' all white\nMe and my broski are twins, but we don't look alike\nI don't take naps\nMe and the money are way too attached to go and do that\nMuscle relax (Ha! Ha! Ha!)\nThat and the spliff put me right on my back, I gotta unpack (Yah!)\nVirginia Black (Doo! Doo!)\nI could go make enough money off that and not even rap\nWhat's that? Facts (Facts, nigga, yah!)\nContract max, I gotta bring that shit back (Blah!)\n\nHerm\u00e8s link (Woo! Woo!), ice-blue mink (Yah!)\nTat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is\nThey want me gone, out of the picture (Yah!)\nBury me now and I only get bigger\nThat's word to my, word to my\u2014\n\nI'm so hot, yeah, I\u2019m so right now (Right now)\nWho's not gang, bitch? Let me find out (Ha!)\nKeep hearin' clicks when I'm talkin' on the iPhone\nFeds in the city hate to see us on a high note (Woo!)\nI switch flow like I switch time zone\nCan't get Nobu, but you can get Milestone (Baka)\nI got a new mansion, 'cause I outgrew the condo\nGotta do Maybach, she wanna fuck on the drive home\nYeah, met her once and I got through (Yah!)\nI'm never washed, but I'm not new\nI know I said top five, but I'm top two\nAnd I'm not two and I got one\nThought you had one, but it's not one, nigga, nah\n\nHerm\u00e8s link, ice-blue mink (Yah!)\nTat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is\nThey want me gone (Gone, blah!), wait for the kicker\nBury me now and I only get bigger\nThat's word to my nigga (Woo! Woo!)\nYah!",
