 "lyrics": "She said she wanna stay together\nI don't think I can, ooh\n\nRed light, you know I can't make this thing that official\nBelieve we had a great night but I ain't the type to tell you that I miss you, shit\nYou don't like that I make this easy, leaving after sexing on the floor\nBaby, I know you need me like I need you, but I'm not the one you wanna love\n\nSo just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me\nLoving ain't the same with a nigga like\nYou used to them but ain't no loving me\nI hear what you would say and girl, it's clear to see\nYou should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me\nYou probably go insane with a nigga like me\nLet's just party 'til we can't, ain't no loving me\nAnd I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me\nSo don't come looking for love\nOh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love\nDon't come looking for love\nOh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love\n\nShawty if you looking for somebody trying to settle down\nProbably won't be around, nah baby\nYou should hit me when you tired\nOf playing up in the house and ain't nobody around, you need that\nWhen you need that late night\nWe can both make love to the daylight, you got it girl, you got it girl\nBut you know I can't stay right? Uh, nah babe\nAll I want is you so what you tryna do?\n\nSo just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me\nLoving ain't the same with a nigga like\nYou used to them but ain't no loving me\nI hear what you would say and girl, it's clear to see\nYou should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me\nYou probably go insane with a nigga like me\nLet's just party 'til we can't, ain't no loving me\nAnd I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me\nSo don't come looking for love\nOh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love\nDon't come looking for love\nOh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love\n\nNo love, no love, no love, no love, no love\nNo love, no love, no love, no love, no love\nNo love, no love, no love, no love, no love\nNo love, no love, no love, no love, no love\nUntil the morning we can freak, but baby girl, you gotta know\nWe can rumble in these sheets but after this you gotta go\nDon't take it personal, when it feel so good, we tend to get emotional\nBut that is when you find out that it hurts the most, since then I've always been like, trust nobody show no love\n\nPop a couple bands with a nigga like me\nLoving ain't the same with a nigga like\nYou used to them but ain't no loving me\nI hear what you would say and girl, it's clear to see\nYou should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me\nYou probably go insane with a nigga like me\nLet's just party 'til we can't, ain't no loving me\nAnd I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me\nSo don't come looking for love\nOh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love\nDon't come looking for love\nOh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love\n.",
