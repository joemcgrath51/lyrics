 "lyrics": "Everybody needs a little time away\nI heard her say, from each other\nEven lovers need a holiday\nFar away from each other\n\nHold me now, it's hard for me to say I'm sorry\nI just want you to stay\nAnd after all that you've been through\nI will make it up to you, I promise you, baby\nAnd after all that's been said and done\nYou're just a part of me I can't let go\n\nCouldn't stand to be kept away\nNot for a day, from your body\nWouldn't want to be swept away\nFar away from the one that I love\n\nHold me now, it's hard for me to say I'm sorry\nI just want you to know\nHold me now, I really want to tell you I'm sorry\nI could never let you go\nAnd after all that we've been through\nI will make it up to you, I promise you\nAnd after all that's been said and done\nYou're just a part of me I can't let go\n\nI can't let go",
