We got plenty guns\nKeep two lil' savages on X and they gon' get it done\nAnd them hollow tips do surgery, they gon' clip his lungs\nIt was goin' down on the set, that's when this shit was fun\nI just been ballin' on these niggas like I'm Kendrick Nunn\nEvery day my birthday, bitch, it's lit, I just turned twenty-one\n\nDecorate your block with red tape, foenem slidin' every day\nBunch of hollows spittin' out the Glock\nI been servin' fiends all day, out there posted with the gang\nNigga, we was taught to get it off the block\nIt's a hundred bands in the safe, now I got expensive taste\nMike Amiri jeans, fill 'em up with knots\nI been on my grind every day, don't believe in takin' breaks\nI ain't stoppin' 'til we chillin' at the top\n\nEver since I stepped up in this game, I've been a bomb threat\nI was in the trenches, tryna see a life beyond that\n'Cause complacent niggas usually die up in they complex\nNigga, where I'm from, they turn death into a contest\nLivin' by the gun, put all my trust into this compact\nMy niggas went to war, but they ain't get no Vietnam check\nLil' bro want his head, he tryna make his brains ooze\nLil' bitch, I'm from the Northside where they raise goons\nTook losses in these streets, shit got me singin' gang blues\nI been a real nigga 'fore this shit became cool\nI'm the type to switch my watch up every time I change moods\nHe the type to get excited 'cause he made The Shade Room\n\nDecorate your block with red tape, foenem slidin' every day\nBunch of hollows spittin' out the Glock\nI been servin' fiends all day, out there posted with the gang\nNigga, we was taught to get it off the block\nIt's a hundred bands in the safe, now I got expensive taste\nMike Amiri jeans, fill 'em up with knots\nI been on my grind every day, don't believe in takin' breaks\nI ain't stoppin' 'til we chillin' at the top",
