How your little man doing in New Jersey?\nLast I heard he caught the flu and you was worried\nHope he feels better, and thanks Jonetta from Cleveland\nFor that good head in your Jetta, better believe it\nShanice, you're my piece from Compton, before I'm off the plane\nMake sure you cop some trees to spark up\nDanielle, ATL, got them pictures in the mail\nYou sealed with a kiss and you sent it with Chanel\nYou looking good in that one showing off your body\nHad a Beverly Hills mami that would buy me Cartis\nTake me to afterparties, her name was Khari\nAnd it sucks that we didn't keep in touch, I'm sorry\nBut, hey Kim, how's Minneapolis?\nYou so pretty, hate you show off your titties for silly classes\nCause I love you girls, though you ain't mine\nI wish my arms was long enough to hug you all of the same time\n\nI'm calling (Yeah, maybe I'm selfish)\nOut to (I want you to myself, I can't help it)\nAll my (Yeah, maybe I'm selfish)\nY'all my ladies\nAnd I can't (Maybe I'm selfish)\nLet you, let you (I want you to myself, I can't help it)\nBe with (Yeah) no one (Yeah)\nBut me (Yeah) baby\n\nI'm calling (Calling)\nOut to (Out to)\nAll my (All my)\nY'all my ladies\nAnd I can't (I can't)\nLet you (Let you)\nBe with no one\nBut me, baby",
