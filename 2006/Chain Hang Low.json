(Oh)\nDo your chain (Oh) hang (Oh) low?\n\nIs that ya chain?\n'Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang\nHop out the ride and let the dime smoke off the range\nJust by the chain, you can tell the big kid do his thang\nYou know the name\nIs that ya chain?\n'Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang\nHop out the ride and let the dime smoke off the range\nJust by the chain, you can tell the big kid do his thang\nI'm off the chain\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm hot, kid\nChain so low, you would think the diamonds never stopped it\nAnd it's funny 'cause you could never stop it\nA bunch of rocks on my hand and I ain't even on the block, kid\nShow 'em white gold, sorta hold it like my Timbs\nAnd the chain hang twenty-four inches like the rims\nDiamonds all blown up (Yeah), sorta like a pimp\nSo when the light hit the ice, it starts glistenin' off the tip (Glistenin' off the tip)\nMy chain hang, all it do is bling-bling\nHalf blue, half red, like my diamonds gang-bang\nAnd I don't even think we on the same thang\nYo, I'm so heavy, they couldn't lift it 'til the crane came (Yeah)\n\nDo your chain hang low?\nDo it wobble to the flo'?\nDo it shine in the light?\nIs it platinum, is it gold?\nCould you through it over your shoulder?\nIf ya hot, it'd make ya cold?\nDo your chain hang low?\n\nDo your chain hang low?\nDo it wobble to the flo'?\nDo it shine in the light?\nIs it platinum, is it gold?\nCould you through it over your shoulder?\nIf ya hot, it'd make ya cold?\nDo your chain hang low?\n\n(Chain) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nI'm so icy (Do your chain\u2014)\nCharm so heavy that my neck don't like me (Do your chain\u2014)\nGone and no, no, no, its not a game, kid (Do your chain\u2014)\n'Cause I'll throw my chain in the crowd like dang these\n(Do your chain\u2014) (This is nothin')\nDiamonds is nothin' to me (Do it shine\u2014)\nEspecially when I'm dressin' up, it's just a button to me (Bling)\n(Could you through it over your shoulder?)\nAnd not to mention my Ts\n'Cause they color coordinated, complimentin' the teeth (Alright, thanks)\nSo check out my swag\nDiamonds red, white and blue like the American flag (Do it shine\u2014) (It's so colorful)\nAnd see I got that nice cream\nHow money I spent on jewels, I call it my ice cream (Ch-ch-chain)\nGive you a black eye 'cause of the beating\nThey think I am a mutant, the way ya boy is beasting (Ch-ch-chain)\nI stay winning some time, you'll call it cheating\nAnd my boys always around (Oh) like it's a meeting\n\nIs that ya chain?
