Or is it this cash that's just\nWay too reckless? Or is it this necklace?\nWait, let me interrupt myself with this message, see...\n\nI don't wanna be loved, I don't wanna be loved\nI just want a quickie\nNo bite marks, no scratches, and no hickies\nIf you can get with that, mami come get with me\nI don't wanna be loved, I don't wanna be loved\nI just want a quick fix\nUp in your mix, miss, send me you wishlist\nI have you addicted, so mami come hit this\n\nMami I realize that I'm mannish\nI speak a language of love like Spanish\n\"Quero fugir\"\nI'm so obscene, know what I mean?\nYeah, sorry that was Portuguese\nThat I speak with ease\u2014please (aha)\nGet on them knees\nI got a penny for your thoughts if you know what I mean, but...\n\nI don't wanna be loved, I don't wanna be loved\nI just want a quickie\nNo bite marks, no scratches, and no hickeys\nIf you can get with that, mami come get with me\nI don't wanna be loved, I don't wanna be loved\nI just want a quick fix\nUp in your mix, miss, send me your wishlist\nI have you addicted, so mami come hit this\n\nDon't be offended, babe, by what I say\nIt's just a game, and how I play\nPillage and plunder, call me your plumber\nKnock on this wood, get rocked by this thunder\nDon't be offended, babe, by what I say\nIt's just a game, and how I play\nPillage and plunder, call me your plumber\nKnock on this wood, get rocked by this thunder\n\nI don't wanna be loved, I don't wanna be loved\nI just want a quickie\nNo bite marks, no scratches, and no hickies\nIf you can get with that, mami come get with me\nI don't wanna be loved, I don't wanna be loved\nI just want a quick fix\nUp in your mix, miss, send me you wishlist\nI have you addicted, so mami come hit this\nI don't wanna be loved, I don't wanna be loved\nI just want a quickie\nNo bite marks, no scratches, and no hickies\nIf you can get with that, mami come get with me\nI don't wanna be loved, I don't wanna be loved\nI just want a quick fix\nUp in your mix, miss, send me you wishlist\nI have you addicted, so mami come hit this\nI don't wanna be loved, I don't wanna be loved\nI just want a quickie\nNo bite marks, no scratches, and no hickies\nIf you can get with that, mami come get with me\nI don't wanna be loved, I don't wanna be loved\nI just want a quick fix\nUp in your mix, miss, send me you wishlist\nI have you addicted...",
