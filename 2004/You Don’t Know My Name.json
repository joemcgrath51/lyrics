(Ooh, ooh, ooh)\nDoin' more than I've ever done for anyone's attention\nTake notice of what's in front of you\n'Cause did I mention? (Oww!)\nYou're 'bout to miss a good thing\nAnd you'll never know how good it feels to have all of my affection\nAnd you'll never get a chance to experience my lovin' (Oww)\n\n'Cause my lovin' feels like ooh\nBut you don't know my name\n('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)\nAnd I swear it feels like ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)\nBut you don't know my name\n('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)\n\nWill you ever know it?\nNo no no no no, no no\nWill you ever know it?\n\n\"I'm gonna have to just go ahead and call this boy\nHello? Can I speak to -- to Michael?\nOh hey, how you doin'?\nUh, I feel kinda silly doin' this, but uhh...\nThis is the waitress from the coffee house on 39th and Lennox\nYou know, the one with the braids?\nYeah, well I see you on Wednesdays all the time\nYou come in every Wednesday on your lunch break, I think\nAnd you always order the special, with the hot chocolate\nAnd my manager be tripping and stuff\nTalking 'bout we gotta use water\nBut I always use some milk and cream for you\n'Cause I think you're kinda sweet\nAnyway, you always got on some fly blue suit\n'N your cuff links are shining all bright\nSo, whatchu do? Oh, word? Yeah, that's interesting\nLook man, I mean I don't wanna waste your time, but...\nI know girls don't usually do this\nBut I was wondering if maybe we could get together\nOutside the restaurant one day?\n'Cause I do look a lot different outside my work clothes\nI mean, we could just go across the street to the park right here\nWait, hold up, my cell phone's breakin' up, hold up\nCan you hear me now? Yeah\nSo, what day did you say?\nOh yeah, Thursday's perfect, man\"\n\nAnd it feels like ooh\nBut you don't know my name\n('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)\nBaby, baby, I swear, it's like ooh\nBut you don't know my name, no no no\n('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)\nAnd it feels like ooh\nBut you don't know my name\n('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)\n\nAnd I swear on my mother and father it feels like...\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh\nOoh, ooh, ooh\nBut you don't know my name\n('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)",
