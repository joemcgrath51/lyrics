 "lyrics": "Love\nSo many things I've got to tell you\nBut I'm afraid I don't know how\n'Cause there's a possibility\nThat you'll look at me differently\nLove\nEver since the first moment I spoke your name\nFrom then on I knew that by you being in my life\nThings were destined to change 'cause\n\nLove\nSo many people use your name in vain\nLove\nThose who have faith in you sometimes go astray\nLove\nThrough all the ups and downs the joys and hurts\nLove\nFor better or worse I still will choose you first\n\nMany days I've longed for you\nWanting you\nHoping for the chance to get to know you\nLonging for your kiss\nFor your touch, your feel, your Presence\nMany nights I've cried from the things you do\nFelt like I could die from the thought of losing you\nI know that you're real\nWith no doubts and no fears\nAnd no questions\n\nSo many people use your name in vain\nLove\nThose who have faith in you sometimes go astray\nLove\nThrough all the ups and downs the joys and hurts\nLove\nFor better or worse I still will choose you first\n\nAt first you didn't mean that much to me, no\nBut now I know you're all I need\nThe world looks so brand new to me\nNow that I found love\nEveryday I live for you, yeah\nAnd everything that I do, I do it for you\nWhat I say is how I feel so believe it's true\nYou got to know I'm true\n\nLove\nSo many people use your name in vain\nLove\nThose who have faith in you sometimes go astray\nLove\nThrough all the ups and downs the joys and hurts\nLove\nFor better or worse I still will choose you first\nLove\nSo many people use your name in vain\nLove\nThose who have faith in you sometimes go astray\nLove\nThrough all the ups and downs the joys and hurts\nLove\nFor better or worse I still will choose you first\nLove",
