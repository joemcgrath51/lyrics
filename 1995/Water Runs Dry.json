 "lyrics": "We don't even talk anymore\nAnd we don't even know what we argue about\nDon't even say \"I love you\" no more\nCause saying how we feel is no longer allowed\nSome people work things out\nAnd some just don't know how to change\n\nLet's don't wait till the water runs dry\nWe might watch our whole lives pass us by\nLet's don't wait till the water runs dry\nWe'll make the biggest mistake of our lives\nDon't do it, baby\n\nNow, now they can see the tears in our eyes\nBut we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts\nWell, maybe that's a pain we can't hide\nCause everybody knows that we're both torn apart\nWhy do we hurt each other?\nWhy do we push love away?\n\nLet's don't wait till the water runs dry\nWe might watch our whole lives pass us by\nLet's don't wait till the water runs dry\nWe'll make the biggest mistake of our lives\nDon't do it, baby\nSome people will work things out\nAnd some just don't know how to change\n\nLet's don't wait till the water runs dry\nWe might watch our whole lives pass us by\nLet's don't wait till the water runs dry\nWe'll make the biggest mistake of our lives\nDon't do it, baby\nDon't do it, baby\nDon't do it, baby",
