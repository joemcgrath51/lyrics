 "lyrics": "Oh my, my, my, I'm feeling high\nMy money's gone, I'm all alone\nToo much to see\nThe world keeps turning\nOh what a day, what a day, what a day\nPeace and blessings manifest with every lesson learned\nIf your knowledge were your wealth, then it would be well-earned\nIf we were made in his image, then call us by our names\nMost intellects do not believe in God but they fear us just the same\n\nOh, on and on and on and on\nMy cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone\nOh, on and on and on and on\nAll night 'til the break of dawn\nI go on and on and on and on\nMy cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone\nOh on and on and on and on\nGoddammit, I'ma sing my song\n\nI was born under water\nWith three dollars and six dimes\nYeah, you might laugh\n'Cause you did not do your math\nLike one, two, three\n(Damn, y'all feel that? Oh)\nLike one, two, three\nThe world keeps turning\nOh what a day, what a day, what a day\nThe man that knows something knows that he knows nothing at all\nDoes it seem colder in your summertime and hotter in your fall?\nIf we were made in his image, then call us by our names\nMost intellects do not believe in God but they fear us just the same\n\nOh on and on and on and on\nMy cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone\nOn and on and on and on\nAll night till the vultures swarm\nI go on and on and on and on\nMy cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone\nOn and on and on and on\nMad props to the God JaBorn\n\nI am feeling kinda hungry 'cause my high is coming down\nDon't feed me yours 'cause your food does not endure\nI think I need a cup of tea, the world keeps burning\nOh what a day, what a day, what a day\nYou rush into destruction 'cause you don't have nothing left\nThe mothership can't save you so your ass is gon' get left\nIf we were made in his image, then call us by our names\nMost intellects do not believe in God but they fear us just the same\n\nOh on and on and on and on\nMy cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone\nOh on and on and on, on, on-on, on, on\nYou can't fuck with me, so just leave it alone\nOoh, ooh, wait, on and on and on and on\nMy cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone\nOh on and on and on and on\nAnd on and on",
