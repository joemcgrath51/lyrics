Fine, blowed and dandy\nSilly like I'm hype off candy, gotta big, thick chick named sandy\nIn the farm in the middle of the barn where everybody's feelin crazy\nI went to visit granny's house, now I see why don't nobody leave\nWe constantly, constantly, constantly smokin B's\nToo blitzed to even shake it off, but I still got my head up\nColdhard finna go in the back of the barn and get my big black peter sucked\nPass the hay you silly slut, blaze it up so I can hit that bud\nGet me zoned and i'll be on cause I love to smoke upon hay\n\n\nThe hay got me goin through a stage and I just can't get enough\nSmokin everyday, I got some hay and you know I'm finna roll it up\nMake a cloud, I'm gonna take my mind away from all the bullcrap\nBump my sounds, lay back and roll, mack to the freaks that's on the road\nSometimes I wonder when I was blowed on the streets\nAnybody wanna step to me, I'mma see how rough they be\nIn this session, manifesting on my P's and Q's, never snooze cause I refuse\nInhale, exhale the smell, smokin hay all by myself\nWildstyle, laughin loud, wit my homies by my side\nIf somethin jump off let it ride, on my square when time is live\nEverybody throw it up, go to the barn and get some hay\nWhen I get my choke on, fool you know I'm smokin on......\n\nHay now hay, we smokin up hay in the middle of the barn\nAnd I'm lit up, can't get up, my eyes are red and my head is spinnin\nTook another pull, ridin red bull, got the goofies, can't stop grinnin\nGot a posse full of hoes playin in my braids and we bout to get in em\nOver yonder is the barn where the pals be at and everything funny\nGotta pause some nigga tryna blow my high smokin all that hay with no money\nNow truly this bitch wanna do me, so I hit the 151 Bacardi\nShe high like the sun, thick like cornbread and I'm ready to party\nThat hay got me so gotdamn horny but I don't like that tramp\nThe only reason I'm poppin that coochie cause the ho had a book of foodstamps\nAnd I got the munchies, I need soul food, collard greens or pinto beans\nIf you smoke hay like the conflict do, then you know what the hell I mean\n\n\nRollin down the block\nCar full of flies and the flies tried to rise up out dat door crack\nGot my niggas in the barn smokin on that hay stack\nBack up on the scene from smokin herb so creep up on the wall and all I heard\nWas a bud of mine who dropped a needle in the hay with a funky dime word\nCouldn't be myself, couldn't smoke wit nobody else\nIf I didn't pass it to the left, nigga would have lost my breath\nOpen up the window 'fore I fall and faint but I can't cause I roll around in dat barn ride\nRollin up the hootie hoo, roughest skin roller on dat west side\nNigga come on in, I got some hay, won't you close dat barn door\nNigga what you let them flies out for? Ain't nobody to rich, we poor\nLettin all the contact smoke up in the barn, the flies keep us chokin\nThank you Jesus Christ for all the hay you're givin us cause we'll keep on smokin'",
