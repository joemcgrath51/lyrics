(Pay my bill)\nIf you did, then maybe we could chill\nI don't think you do\nSo, you and me are through\nCan you pay my bills?\nCan you pay my telephone bills?\nDo you pay my automo' bills?\nIf you did, then maybe we could chill\nI don't think you do (Oh, no no, no no)\nSo, you and me are through\n\nYou triflin', good-for-nothing type of brother (Good for nothing)\nOh silly me, why haven't I found another? (Found another)\nYou triflin', good-for-nothing type of brother (Hey)\nOh silly me, why haven't I found another? (Oh-ooh-whoa)\nYou triflin', good-for-nothing type of brother (Oh-ooh no, no)\nOh silly me, why haven't I found another? (No no, no no, no no, no no)\nYou triflin', good-for-nothing type of brother (Good for nada, hey)\nOh silly me, why haven't I found another?\n\nCan you pay my bills?\nCan you pay my telephone bills?\nDo you pay my automo' bills?\nIf you did, then maybe we could chill\nI don't think you do\nSo, you and me are through\nCan you pay my bills?\nCan you pay my telephone bills?\nDo you pay my automo' bills? (Telephone)\nIf you did, then maybe we could chill (Please pay the bills)\nI don't think you do (I don't think you do)\nSo, you and me are through\nCan you pay my bills?\nCan you pay my telephone bills?\nDo you pay my automo' bills?\nIf you did, then maybe we could chill\nI don't think you do\nSo, you and me are through\nCan you pay my bills?\nCan you pay my telephone bills?\nDo you pay my automo' bills?\nIf you did, then maybe we could chill\nI don't think you do\nSo, you and me are through\n\nThou shalt confess",
