We do this every night\nAnd then we always wake up singing the same song\n\nIt's 5 o' clock in the morning (Yeah)\nConversation got boring (Talk to me, girl)\nYou said you'd go into bed soon (Let's go)\nSo I snuck off to your bedroom (Come on)\nAnd I thought I'd just wait there (Wait on me)\nUntil I heard you come up the stairs (I won't let you stay lonely)\nAnd I pretended I was sleeping (All right)\nAnd I was hoping you would creep in (Goodnight)\nIt's 5 o' clock in the morning\nThe conversation got boring\nYou said you'd go into bed soon\nSo I snuck off to your bedroom\nAnd I thought I'd just wait there\nUntil I heard you come up the stairs\nAnd I pretended I was sleeping\nAnd I was hoping you would creep in\n\nIt's 5 o'clock in the morning, and you calling\nAnd these females got me stalling\nI can hear your voice in my head like\n\"What is he doing? What is he doing?\"\nCause I keep checking my cell phone\nAnd these missed calls\nAnd you texting me like, \"I'mma kill y'all\nIf you don't get your ass up out of that club\nAnd do you know what time it is?\"\n(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) Ooh, and my bad, girl\nAnd this Nuvo got me trippin and I know that you mad, girl\nBut you ain't got to worry about nothing (worry 'bout nothing)\nGirl I got you, girl I got you\nShe might come and find me (Oh, no, no)\nAnd then ask me kindly (Oh, no, no)\nDo I want her to go crazy? We do this every night\nAnd then we always wake up singing the same song\n\nIt's 5 o' clock in the morning (Yeah)\nConversation got boring (Talk to me, girl)\nYou said you'd go into bed soon (Let's go)\nSo I snuck off to your bedroom (Come on)\nAnd I thought I'd just wait there (Wait on me)\nUntil I heard you come up the stairs (I won't let you stay lonely)\nAnd I pretended I was sleeping (Alright)\nAnd I was hoping you would creep in (Baby girl, goodnight)\nIt's 5 o' clock in the morning\nThe conversation got boring\nYou said you'd go into bed soon\nSo I snuck off to your bedroom\nAnd I thought I'd just wait there\nUntil I heard you come up the stairs\nAnd I pretended I was sleeping\nAnd I was hoping you would creep in\nIt's 5 o' clock in the morning\n\nOh-oh, and you ain't got nothing on\nBut the t-shirt that I left over your house\nThe last time I came and put it on ya\nToo many thirsty girls up in this club\nFor me to leave here with one of them, that's why I call her\nAnd you'll be right at home waiting for me\nIPhone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me\nClub closed at 6, left around 4:30\nYeah, so by the time I'm at your crib\n(It\u2019s 5\u2032O Clock in the morning) And you yawning\nBut I\u2019ve been drinking all night and I feel like performing\nWith you in the bedroom, floor to the dresser\nDont want nothing less cause I\u2019m sure you\u2019re the best\nYou\u2019re the one, so I let you, thats how you show me love\nAnd when we finish you like \u201cdamn, babe you woke me up\u201d\nI like you way you put it down, like its for both of us\nThe sun ain't the only thing thats coming up\n\nIt's 5 o' clock in the morning\nConversation got boring\nYou said you'd go into bed soon\nSo I snuck off to your bedroom\nAnd I thought I'd just wait there\nUntil I heard you come up the stairs\nAnd I pretended I was sleeping\nAnd I was hoping you would creep in\nIt's 5 o' clock in the morning",
