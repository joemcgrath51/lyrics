Listen, all virgins are liars honey\nAnd I don't know what I'm scared of or what I even enjoy\nDulling, get money, but nothing turns out like you want it to\n\nAnd in these \nplagued streets of pity\n \nyou can buy anything\nFor 200 anyone can conceive a God on video\nHe's a boy, you want a girl so tear off his cock\nTie his hair in bunches, fuck him, call him Rita if you want\n\nI eat and I dress and I wash and I still can say thank you\nPuking - shaking - sinking I still stand for old ladies\nCan't shout, can't scream, hurt myself to get pain out\n\nI 'T' them, 24:7, all year long\nPurgatory's circle, drowning here, someone will always say yes\nFunny place for the social, for the insects to start caring\nJust an ambulance at the bottom of a cliff\n\nAnd in these \nplagued streets of pity\n \nyou can buy anything\nFor 200 anyone can conceive a God on video\nHe's a boy, you want a girl so tear off his cock\nTie his hair in bunches, fuck him, call him Rita if you want\nIf you want\n\nI eat and I dress and I wash and I can still say thank you\nPuking - shaking - sinking I still stand for old ladies\nCan't shout, can't scream, I hurt myself to get pain out\nPower produces desire, the weak have none\nThere's no lust in this coma even for a fifty\nSolitude, solitude,\n \nthe 11th commandment\n\nThe only certain thing that is left about me\nThere's no part of my body that has not been used\nPity or pain, to show displeasure's shame\nEveryone I've loved or hated always seems to leave\n\nAnd in these \nplagued streets of pity\n \nyou can buy anything\nFor 200 anyone can conceive a God on video\nHe's a boy, you want a girl so tear off his cock\nTie his hair in bunches, fuck him, call him Rita if you want\nIf you want\n\nPower produces desire, the weak have none\nThere's no lust in this coma even for a fifty\nSolitude, solitude,\n \nthe 11th commandment\nDon't hurt, just obey, lie down, do as they say\nMay as well be heaven this hell, smells the same\nThese sunless afternoons I can't find myself\n\nTwo dollars you rub her tits\nThree dollars you rub her ass\nFive dollars you can play with her pussy\nOr you can lick her tits\nChoice is yours",
